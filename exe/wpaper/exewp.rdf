title: Fiscal Policy, Public Debt Stabilization and Politics: Theory and Evidence from the US and UK
author-name: Lockwood, Ben
author-name: Philippopoulos, Apostolis 
author-name: Snell, Andy
abstract: This paper presents a two-party model of fiscal and debt policy which; (i) explicitly models the partisan, stabilisation, and (to some extent) survival motives of politicians; (ii) has predictions that are largely consistent with existing empirical findings about partisan and electoral effects in government expenditure, tax revenue, and debt; (iii) yields new predictions about how the feedback of fiscal policy on lagged debt may depend on partisan and electoral effects. These new predictions are not rejected by a test of the model on US and UK data.

title: The Rational Expectations Hypothesis of the Term Structure: Reconciling the Evidence
author-name: Tzavalis, Elias 
author-name: Wickens, Michael 
abstract: The main aim of this paper is to test the rational expectations hypothesis of the term structure (REHTS). Existing empirical studies of the REHTS provide inconsistent evidence. Tests based on the local expectations hypothesis (LEH) version of the REHTS tend to be far less supportive than those based on the return to maturity expectations hypothesis (RTMEH), especially when they concern the short-run implications of the hypothesis. This paper explains the differences between these alternative versions of the REHTS and estimates a number of models to try to explain the inconsistencies in previous results. Our conclusions are that the most probable cause of these differences is the failure to take account of the presence of a time-varying term premium. Once this is accounted for both short-run and long-run evidence is found to support the REHTS. Estimates of variance bounds of the term premium suggest that it may not vary sufficiently to be the sole explanation for the differences.

title: The Joint Density of Two Functionals of a Brownian Motion
abstract: In time series containing an autoregressive unit root, almost all known statistics can be described in terms of two Wiener functionals. It is therefore crucial for us to know how these functionals are jointly distributed in terms of explicit formulae that can be manipulated analytically, that do not contain integrals and that can be computed quickly and exactly. This paper shows how such distributions are arrived at; thus solving the problem, as well as paving the way for similar derivations in the future for the case of different stochastic processes. Also, a formula is provided to simplify the calculation of the distribution of any statistic that can be fully characterized in terms of these functionals, thus remedying the specific problem of unit-root distributions which have drastically different formula for each statistic.

abstract: Let Xt be a discrete multivariate autoregressive process of order 1.

The formula is then specialized to some cases of interest, including the mgf of functionals of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

The formula is exact, and it consists of highly efficient convergent expansion. It is used to plot the density. Furthermore, it is manipulated analytically to reveal features that could not be uncovered by Monte Carlo. For example, it is demonstrated that moments of any integer order exist, and the derived unconditional (marginal) density is compared to the conditional one which is normal.

title: The Asymptotic Influence of VAR Dimension on Estimator Biases.
abstract: We show that in a purely nonstationary Vector Autoregression (VAR), the biases of Maximum Likelihood and Least Squares Estimators are asymptotically proportional to the dimension of the system, even when the equations and regressors are generated independantly of each other. When some stable linear combinations exist, as when the variables are cointegrated, these biases are in general asymptotically proportional to the sum of the characteristic roots of the VAR. Adding irrelevant variables to a VAR is thus shown to have more serious negative consequences in integrated time series than in classical ergodic or cross section analyses.

title: Cointegration Theory, Equilibrium and Disequilibrium Economics.
abstract:Two or more variables are said to be cointegrated when they move closely togather over time, after proper scaling. Cointegration was taken to be the statistical expression of the notion of equilibrium in economics. But is it still possible to talk of cointegration when "disequilibrium" economics prevails? This note argues that it is, and that the duality is strongest between cointegration theory and economic theories of nonclearing markets. By setting up a simple model, it is shown that Clower's (1965) Dual Decision Hypothesis is a more direct and natural expression of the notion of cointegration than Walrasian equilibrium is.

abstract:This paper investigates how unemployment persistence affects the various proposals advanced as solutions to the problem of inflation bias (namely delegation, contracts and reputation). First, the contract solution is extended to cover the dynamic case. However, as such contracts are not used in practice, we focus on delegation solution. We find that the delegation of policy to a conservative Central Banker still proves attractive in a setting where unemployment persists; but the degree of conservatism depends critically on how the Central Banker discounts the future. Where the Central Banker discounts the future hardly at all, we find that the appropriate strategy is to delegate to candidates who are more conservative the more persistant is unemployment. Finally, we consider briefly how reputational factors might affect this result.

title: Commodity Tax Hamonisation with Public Goods - An Alternative Perspective.
author-name: Lockwood, B.
abstract: This paper investigates whether it is possible to find Pareto- improving commodity tax reforms that harmonise taxes between two countries when governments supply public goods and thus have revenue requirements. It is shown that, with two goods, and starting from Nash equilibrium taxes, any harmonising reform will always make both countries worse off (better off) if the imported good is taxed less heavily (more heavily) than the exported good by both countries. An example suggests that harmonisation is unlikely to be Pareto-improving if the revenue requirement is high, and the demand for imports is relatively price elastic. An alternative definition of harmonisation, difference harmonisation, which may yield Pareto-improvements under more general conditions is proposed.

These questions are pertinent in the context of current EU policy decions. Using two models of stochastic frontier production and a set of panel data on 35 farms from the South West of England for the years 1987-1991, we obtain an indication that there is a positive, though weak relationship between technical efficiency and the use of contaminants, and between technical efficiency and farm size. However, there is a negligible negative relationship between farm size and use of contaminants.

If countries act cooperatively, the tax instruments used in combination achieve the same outcome, either the first-best or the constrained second-best, as direct production control. When a single country regulates the oligopoly, circumstances are shown to exist in which taxation is superior to production control.

Complete definitions of integration and cointegration are given, some of them extending earlier definitions of these concepts.

title: Tax Evasion, Social Customs and Optimal Auditing.
author-name: Myles, G.D.
author-name: Naylor, R.A.
abstract: The optimal audit policy is analysed for an independent revenue service when a social custom exists that rewards honest tax-paying. The implication of the existence of the social custom is that in equilibrium the income level of a taxpayer cannot always be inferred exactly from their report. The structure of the optimal audit policy is determined both for a fixed (report-invariant) audit probability and for when the audit probability is a function of the income report. For the constant probability of audit it is shown that an interior solution exists to the decision problem of the revenue service and comparative statics results are given. When the audit probability can vary, the audit function is proved to be a decreasing function of the income report which reaches zero at the highest income report of a tax evader. Increases in the fine for evading and in the tax rate raise the optimal audit probability.

Contradictory theoretical predictions about the nature of supermarkets' pricing behaviour are compared by highlighting the main underlying behavioural assumptions. These theoretical predictions are tested empirically using disaggregated data from the Italian grocery trade. The emprirical results provide evidence for the existence, in all types of retail organisation, of the form of price discrimination suggested in Bliss (1984). The results are consistent with discrimination due to the exploitation of consumers' switching costs.

The functions and series we use in quantitative economics are all special cases of them. In this paper, a unified approach to hypergeometic functions is given. As a result, some potentially useful general applications emerge such as in statistical distribution theory, applied econonometrics and economic theory. The greatest benefit from using these functions stems from the fact that they provide the parsimonious explicit (and interpretable) solutions to a wide range of general problems.

Such asymmetric information is shown ato arise naturally in multi-period settings where the CB and private sector can aquire over time information about processes generating supply shocks.

This is true whether endogenous price movements make the real income of farmers more or less volatile than that of other groups. It is also demonstrated that even in a closed economy introduction of an unambiguously more productive technology may make everyone worse off.

Such models cause the conventinal Antithetic Variate (AV) technique to fail, and will be proved to reduce the benefit from using Control Variates with nearly non-stationary series. This paper suggest modifications of the two conventional variance reduction techniques to enhance their efficiency. New classes of AV's are also proposed. Methods of reordering residuals are found to do less well than others wich rely on changing signs in the spirit of the traditional AV. Then, unconventional applications of these techniques of MC work for nearly nonstationary series. It generates econometric estimators at one and a half times the speed of conventional MC.

author-name: Lockwood, Ben
abstract: A simple folk theorem of repeated games states that Pareto-efficient outcomes can be achieved in a perfect equilibrium where deviations are punished by a reversion to Nash equilibrium of the associated stage game (Nash threats equilibrium), provided that players are sufficiently patient. In a dynamic version of a well-known monetary policy game we show that such asymptotic efficiency may not be possible, as the presence of a state variable introduces the possibility of state manipulation. Moreover, the lowest inflation rate in Nash threats equilibrium may be increasing as players become more patient.

abstract: Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rates, or FEERs, are defined as the real exchange rate which would prevail if the economy were to be in internal and external equilibrium. As such they have been widely used both for policy purposes and as a method of calculating the level to which the real exchange rate might tend in the medium run. This paper addresses the issue of the sensitivity of FEERs to changes in the assumptions underlying these calculations. We quantify the sensitivity of the FEER calculations to various parameters and inputs, and show that in many cases the changes induced in the FEER are large.

This is done considering time consistent policies within a small theoretical two country model, with parameter values chosen from empirical work. The model builds on earlier work by incoporating a forward looking inflation mechanism. Our results suggest that there are significant costs associated with Monetary Union, particularly when fiscal policy is not used as a stabilisation tool.

title: Irrational Analysts' Expectations as a Cause of Excess Volatility in Stock Prices
author-name: Bulkley, George 
author-name: Harris, Richard 
abstract: This paper investigates whether excess stock price volatility may be due in part to a failure of the market to form rational expectations. Using data on analysts' expectations of long run earnings growth for individual companies, we report a number of interelated results which lend support to this hypothesis. First we show that there is no statistically significant relationship between analysts' long run forecasts and subsequent earnings growth, suggesting that analysts' earnings expectations are excessively dispersed. Secondly, we provide evidence that analysts' expectations are reflected in market prices. These two results together imply that the cross-section of stock prices will also be excessively dispersed, so that stocks with low earnings expectations are underpriced and stocks with high earnings expectations are overpriced. As analysts' forecasts errors become apparent, stock prices should adjust accordingly and so excess returns should accrue. We demonstrate that analysts' forecasts are indeed negatively correlated with subsequent excess returns. All hypothesis testing uses panel regression techniques, and to circumvent the problem of cross-sectional dependence in the data we use a generalised method of moments estimator of the parameter covariance matrix.

title: Why Does the Ratio of Book to Market Value of Equity Explain Cross-Section Stock Returns? 
author-name: Bulkley, George 
author-name: Harris, Richard 
abstract: A number of papers have reported evidence that cross-section stock returns can be explained by the ration of the book value of complanies' assets to their market value. The unresolved issue, which we address here, is whether this evidence is consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis. We argue that the efficient markets model, which implies that book to market is a proxy for risk, implies also that it is a noisy proxy. This same model also presents a way to clean up this variable so that it explains stock returns more successfully. Removing the noise from book to market in this way should improve its explanatory power under the efficient markets hypothesis, while under the alternative hypothesis of irrational pricing it should cause its explanatory power to deteriorate. We present evidence in this paper that its explanatory power deteriorates.

title: Does Asset Ownership Always Motivate Managers? The Property Rights Theory of the Firm with Alternating - Offers Bargaining
author-name: De Meza, D.
author-name: Lockwood, Ben
abstract: This paper studies the Hart-Grossmn-Moore property rights approach to the theory of the firm, under the alternative assumption that bargaining over gains from trade is modelled strategically, rather than axiomatically. With strategic bargaining, the disagreement payoffs (payoffs to the two managers if they do not trade with each other) affect the managers' agreement payoffs, and hence the incentive to invest, very differently than in the axiomatic case. A key result is that extra asset ownership may decrease incentives to invest. Sufficient conditions afor intgrateion and non-integration to be optimal that have been developed for the axiomatic case are shown not to apply to the strategic case. On the contrary, type i  integration (giving all the assets to manager i ) is shown often to be desireable if motivation manager i ? j is particlularly important. Also, in contrast to the axiomatic case, no-trade prices have a role to play in improving efficience of investment.

author-name: Coco, Guiseppe 
abstract: This paper examines the argument that the availability of collateral rules out credit rationing. A model of the credit market with ex-ante asymmetric information and heterogeneous entrepreneurs' attitudes towards risk is set up. It is shown that, due to the interplay between project choice and entrepreneurs' preferences, using collateral as a signal to screen safer projects may prove impossible. Instead, a partially-separating two-contracts equilibrium with rationing at one contract emerges. Contrary to previous theoretical research and consistently with conventional wisdom and systematic evidence, the use of collateral is never negatively correlated with project risk.

title: Inter-Regional Insurance
author-name: Lockwood, Ben
abstract: This paper considers the problem facing a central government which can transfer resources between regional governments by use of intergovernmental grants. Regions provide a public good and are subject to privately observed shocks either to income, or demand for, or cost of, the public good. There may be public good spillovers between regions. In this set-up, central government has an insurance role, and possibly also a role as co-ordinator of regional public good provision. When grants are chosen to maximise regional expected utility, notatble results are; (i) depending on the source of the shock, the grant may induce over- or undersupply of the public good relative to the Samuelson rule; (ii) with asymmetric information, and with spollovers, there is a two way distortion  of public good supply - that is, qualitatively different distortions (relative to the Samuelson rule) at different points in the support of the distribution of the shock; (iii) with symmetric information, the optimal grant is always linear in the public good, but with asymmetric information, the grant will have a quasi-concave or quasi-convex, rather than an constant slope, depending on the source of the shock.

abstract: With the adoption of an explicit inflation target in the UK, there has been renewed interest in the properties of alternative feedback rules for interest rates based on an inflation target. In this paper we compare the stabilisation properties of the two forms of feedback rule that have been used most frequently in the literature and in policy disculssion, Specifically, we examine the relative merits of relating excess inflation to the level of real interest rates, or the change in nominal interest arates in the face of various types of shock. We explain why the relative performance of the rules is dependent upon the nature of the shock considered and whether or not excess inflation is defined in terms of consumer or output price inflation.

title: Inference for Unit Roots in Dynamic Panels in the Presence of Deterministic Trends
author-name: Harris, Richard 
author-name: Tzavalis, Elias 
abstract: This paper proposes a similar unit root testing procedure for heterogeneous dynamic panel data, based on the score principle, assuming that the time dimension of the panel is fixed. It is shown that the limiting distribution of the test is standard normal. The similarity with regard to the initial conditions and the heterogeneity (fixed effects) of the panel is achieved by considering a parameterization of the autoregressive model which allows for a trend under both the null and the alternative hypotheses, without introducing any irrelevant variables under either. Simulation evidence suggests that the proposed tests have empirical size that is very close to the nominal 5% level and considereably more power than other panel unit root tests and the corresponding unit root tests for the single time series case. As an application of our test, we re-examine whether real dividends and stock prices follow drifting random walks. In contrast with many earlier studies, we find that both real dividends and real stock prices are stationary around a deterministic trend.

title: Tests of the Expectations Hypothesis of the Term Structure in a Model with Bayesian Learning
author-name: Bulkley, George

author-name: Weller, Paul 
abstract: Evidence that the term structure of interest rates does not satisfy the expectations hypothesis has been reported in a number of papers. However the nature and degree of this rejection is very sensitive to the exact specification of the tests. In this paper, we identify a source of small sample bias that is consistent with this empirical finding. The direction of the bias which we uncover implies that the expections hypothesis is more likely to be true than asymptotic test statistics would suggest. In financial markets, agents often receive information about the future in a form that cannot be explicityly incorporated in an econometric model. We formalise this idea by assuming that agenst supplement forecasts of the short yield obtained from the econometric model with noisy signals of the error term of the model. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the bias is much more pronounced in the specification which has the more decisive rejection of the expectations hypothesis.

abstract: This paper examines the steady-state implications of anticipated inflation within an exogenous monetary growth model with liquidity costs and an endogenous labour supply. Whether or not money is superneutral depends upon the utility function chosen. Monetary growth leaves capital and labour unaffected, when a constant relative risk aversion class of utility functions (with consumption and leisure Edgeworth dependent) is employed. If instead consumption and leisure are Edgeworth independent and at the same time preferences are isoelastic in consumption, what matters for detecting the final effects of long run inflation on capital and labour is the consumption intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

title: Analyst Optimism and the Magnitude of Earnings Growth
author-name: Harris, Richard 
abstract: This papaer evaluates analysts' consensus long run earnings growth forecasts. It is shown that the correlation between forecast earnings growth and actual earnings growth is extremely low. Consistent with other studies, forecast earnings growth is found to be too optimistic. This is illustrated by the fact that almost all earnings growth forecasts are positive, while actual earnings growth is more evenly distributed between positive and negative values. For the sample of companies for which actual earnings growth is positive, there is a stron positive correlation between forecast earnings growth and actual earnings growth. In sharp contrast for a sample of companies for which actual earnings growth is negative, there is a strong inverse correlation between forecast earnings growth and actual earnings growth. This suggests that analysts are to some extendt able to forecast the magnitude of earnings growth but not its sign. It is further shown that analysts' forecasts of long run earnings growth are incorporated into the market's expectation of future earnings growth. However, there is evidence that the market attaches more weight to forecasts that have the correct sign, even though the sign of the actual earnings growth is not known at that datae that the forecast is made.

title: Interest Rates and the Price Level
author-name: Leith, Campbell

author-name: Wren-Lewis, Simon 
abstract: Governments have often combined a monetary policy involving setting nominal interest rates with a fiscal policy that did not seek to target a nominal value of the debt stock. In a model with a traditional backward looking Phillips curve, this fiscal and monetary policy mix may not be stable. If it is stable, then higher interest rates will raise the price level in the long run, even if prices fall in the short term. In the forward looking New Keynesian version of the model, stability requires that governments do not over-adjust fiscal policy in response to changes in the level of readl debt stock. Even if fiscal policy made no attempt to target the real debt stock the model would be stable, because prices can jump on to a stable saddle path which ensures debt stability. In this model a temporary increase in interest raates will always raise inflation and the price level in the short run, and we derive the conditions under which it will raise prices in the long run too.

title: The Non-Neutrality of Border Tax Adjustments for Environmental Taxes Under Imperfect Competition
author-name: McCorriston, Steve
author-name: Sheldon, I.M. 
abstract: The appropriate treatment of imports is an important issue in the design and administration of domestic environmental taxes. With the aim of ensuring that foreign exporters do not attain a competitive advantage, border tax adjustments for domestic environmental taxes are used to neutralise this potential advantage. Since most environmental taxes apply to intermediate goods, the relevant border tax adjustment applies to the final (derivative) imported good. However, when both the intermediate and final goods markets are oligopolistic, border tax adjustments are likely to be non-neutral. This paper shows that the form and level of the appropriate border tax adjustment will depend on the nature of the firms' strategies in both the upstream and downstream stages. Most notably, when firms follow Bertrand strategies, the appropriate border adjustment should be an import subsidy rather than a tax. When firms play Cournot, even though an import tax is the appropriate instrument, setting this equal to the domestic environmental tax is unlikely to restrore neutrality. Consequently, the policy implication is that the tax authorities should account for market structure factors if border tax adjustments are to avoid being overly protectionist.

title: Which alternative to choose: does the excess sensitivity hypothesis or a time varying term premium explain the failure of the rational expectations hypothesis of the term structure?
author-name: Tzavalis, Elias 
abstract: Contrary to the predictions of the rational expectations hypothesis of the term structure, empirical evidence suggest that the term spread between long and short rates fails to forecast future long term rates although its forecasts of future short term rates are in the correct direction. This paper examinines which of two popular alternative hypotheses - the excess sensitivity of the long term rate to the contemporaneous short term rate and the rational expectations hypothesis allowing for a time varying term premium - can explain the failure of the pure version of the expectations theory. Using US data at the short and long end of the term structure, the results clearly reject the excess sensitivity hypothesis, and suggest that the anomalies of the term spread can be attributed to the different way that the term premium affect each of the term spread models. It is found that the term premium influencing the term spread model forecasting future long rates is much more volatile than the term premium of the term spread model forecasting future short term rates. In order to remove the term premium biases from the slope of the term spread a simple model of the term premium is employed.

The economics of education failed to live up to its promising start in the 1960s and gradually ran out of steam. The economics of health, however, has made steady theoretical and empirical progress since 1970, principally in coming to grips with the implications of supplier-induced demand and the difficulties of evaluating health care outcomes.

abstract: In this paper we introduce a unit root test for dynamic panel data models, allowing for cross-sectional heteroscedasticity and serial correlation in the disturbance term. The limiting distribution of the test statistic is derived under the assumption that the time dimension of the panel is fixed. The test statistic is based on the pooled Least Squares estimator of the autoregressive coefficient of the panel data model, adjusted for the inconsistency that arises due to the serial correlation of the disturbance term. The limiting distribution of the test is normal with a variance that depends on the serial correlation and heteroscedasticity nuisance parameters. The paper examines the consequences of ignoring heteroscedasticity and serial correlation in panel data unit root tests.

This paper endogenises the event sequence in a matching model of market equilibrium. Equilibria in which agents invest (in human capital) and buy assets prior to matching are shown to exist and so are immune to Maskin and Tirole's recent criticism that the simplest of ownership arrangements can be improved upon. The model preserves the central feature of the property rights theory, namely that ownership of physical assets affect the incentive to invest.

Although taxes and transfers are linked through the budget-balanced requirement, the analysis reveals intriguing differences. Indeed, it turns out that transfer competition results in much less redistribution than tax competition, while tax-transfer competition involves an intermediate level of redistribution. In each approach, the mobility of the rich is detrimental to redistribution and an increase in the dependency ratio reduces taxes.

abstract: That the Keynesian Revolution in the 1930s marked a water-shed in economics dividing the Young Turks from the Old Guard is too well known to require discussion. But that World War II and the immediate post-war years marked a similar and possibly greater break in the 'paradigm' of professional economists is something which is little appreciated even by historians of economic thought, not to mention workaday modern economists. There was in fact a Formalist Revolution that swept throughout economics with increasing speed in the 1950s, coming to full realisation in the 1960s. I call it a 'formalist' revolution.

title: The Expectations Hypothesis of the Term Structure and Time Varying Risk Premia: a Panel Data Approach.
author-name: Harris, R.
keywords: INTEREST RATE ; RISK ; ECONOMETRIC MODELS ; MODELS ; ECONOMETRICS 
abstract: The expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates implies that the spread between short and long bond yields should forecast next period's change in the long yield. Regression based tests have systematically rejected the expectations hypothesis, with estimated coefficients far from their hypothesized values. One explanation of this rejection is that regression tests fail to account for time varying risk premia that are correlated with the spread, causing a downward bias in the estimated regression parameters. This paper uses panel data in order to test the expectations hypothesis in the presence of time varying risk premia.

keywords: ECONOMETRIC MODELS ; ECONOMETRICS ; MODELS ; INTEREST RATE ; TESTS 
abstract: Empirical tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure hage almost without exception been tests of the time-series properties of interest rates. However, the expectations hypothesis has implications not just for the yield movement of a single pair of bond maturities over a number of periods but also for the relationship between yield movements of a number of bond maturities over a single period. This paper tests these implications of the expectations hypothesis using cross-section bond yield data. A long series of monthly cross-section regressions is estimated using zero coupon bond yields for maturities from two months to thirty-five years.

author-name: Barisone, G.M.
keywords: FISCAL POLICY ; TAXES 
abstract: This paper tests Barro's (1979) tax smoothing model of fiscal policy. The model implies that budget deficits and surpluses are used optimally to minimise the distortionary effects of taxation, given a certain path of spending. The theory has a number of implications both for the statistical time series properties of government budget data and for causality amongst these variables. These implications are derived and tested on a vector autoregression model using annual data for Italy covering the period for the full sample. However, when we consider the post World War II period all of the tests clearly reject the tax smoothing hypothesis.

keywords: ECONOMETRICS ; ECONOMETRIC MODELS ; FORECASTING TECHNIQUES ; FORECASTS 
abstract: A number of volatility forecasting studies have led to the perception that the ARCH- and Stochastic Volatility-type models provide poor out-of-sample forecasts of volatility. This is primarily based on the use of traditional forecast evaluation criteria concerning the accuracy and the unbiasedness of forecasts. In this paper we provide an assessment of volatility forecasting. We use the Log- Volatility framework to show how the inherent noise in the approximation of the actual- and unobservable - volatility by the squared return results in a misleading forecast evaluation. We argue that evaluation problems are likely to be exacebated by non-normality of the shocks and that non-linear and utility-based criteria can be more suitable for the evaluation of volatility forecasts.

abstract: A number of financial variables have been shown to be effective in explaining the time-series of aggregate returns in both the UK and US equity markets. These include, inter alia, the dividend yield, the spread between the yields on long and on short bonds, and lagged equity returns. Recently, however, the gilt-equity yield ratio -the ratio between the long bond yield and the equity dividend yield- has emerged as a variable that has considerable explanatory power for equity returns in the UK. This paper compares the performance of the gilt-Equity yield ratio with these other variables in the UK and US equity markets, prividing evidence on both ex post explanatory power and ex ante predictive ability.

abstract: This paper examines the growth of productivity and technical change in the rapid development of the Chinese economy since China opened its door to the world. Based on a study of available empirical evidence and relevant statistics, the paper argues that there has been remarkable technological progress in China in the period 1979-1996. The original source of that change was China's reform and openness policy. The important role played by foreign trade and foreign direct investment is highlighted. Also the paper suggests that high output growth was more affected by an increased input of resources than by technical change. It is argued that only by improving endogenous growth through increasing the rate of technical-intensive development will China sustain a growing economy.

The results show that generally the second-order approximation is considerably better than its first-order counterpart in ARX models. This is also largely true for AR(1) models except that in such models second-order approximations may be vulnerable in the near unit root case.

abstract: In simultaneous equation models the two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator of the coefficients, though consistent, is biased in general and the nature of this bias has given rise to a good deal of research. However, little if any attention has been given to the bias that arises when an estimate of the asymptotic variance is used to approximate the small sample variance. In this paper we use asymptotic expansions to show that, in general, the asymptotic variance estimator has an upwards bias.

Taylor series expansions are obtained from which first and secomd moment approximationc are derived. While the expansions are essentially equivalent to the traditional Nagar-tupe, the terms are expressed in a form which enables moment approximations to be obtained in a particular straightforward way, once the partial derivatives have been found. The approach is illustrated by considering the k-class estimators in a static simultaneous equation model where the distrubances are non-spherical.

length: 16 pages
abstract: Mikhail (1972a) found that estimated 2SLS biases, obtained through simulation using antithetic variables and control variate methods, were closer to each other than to Nagar's bias approximation to order T-1. As remarked by Kiviet and Phillips (1996), this result represents one of a very small number of higher order approximations in the econometric literature yet there is no published evidence of its accuracy. In this paper the accuracy of the approximation is explored in the context of a framework similar to that chosen by Mikhail (1972a) and it is found that the higher order approximation is clearly superior. In cases where the bias is severe, the results support the belief that, when the first order approximation is poor but not terrible, the higher order approximation mops up most of the error.

We focus primarily on explaining job satisfaction in terms of individual matching to jobs, with the match depending on reservation returns, information sets and job offer rates. In addition, we stylise graduates as a peer group who form satisfaction levels based on their rankings relative to each other. We then examine whether or not education quality which raises peer group status and increases the job offer rate is systematically related to job satisfaction.

abstract: In previous studies, measures of technical inefficiency derived from stochastic production frontiers have been estimated from residuals which are sensitive to specification errors. This study corrects for this inaccuracy by extending the doubly heteroscedastic stochastic cost frontier suggested by Hadri (1999) to stochastic production frontier and to panel data. The extended correction for heteroscedasticity is supported by the data. The study uses data on 102 mainly cereal farms in England, and not only estimates technical efficiency but also examines the links between the efficiency of cereal production, cereal area, chemical usage and labour usage. These links are explored because European Union agricultural policy is no longer narrowly concerned solely with farm income levels and productivity, but also embraces environmental quality and rural development concerns. Whenever there are multiple policy goals it is important to gain an understanding of whether there is conflict or complementarity between them.

keywords: ESTIMATOR ; TIME SERIES ; REGRESSION ANALYSIS
length: 30 pages
abstract: Asymptotic expansions are employed in a dynamic regression model with a unit root in order to find approximations for the bias, the variance and for the mean squared error of the least-squares estimator. For this purpose such expansions are shown to be useful only when the autoregressive model contains at least one non-redundant exogenous explanatory variable. It is found that large sample and small disturbance asymptotic techniques give closely related results in this model, which is not the case in stable dynamic regression models. The results are specialised to the random walk with drift model, where it is seen that the ratio of the standard deviation of the disturbance tot he drift term plays a crucial role. The random walk to the model with drift plus a linear trend is also examined. The accuracy of the approximations are checked in the context of these models making use of a set of Monte Carlo experiments to estimate the true moments.

length: 17 pages
abstract: Previous work on the property rights theory of the firm suggests that in the presence of outside options, ownership may be counter productive in motivating managers. This paper shows that this conclusion depends on the assumption that a manager's outside option only depends on her own investments. In many cases, an owner has the right to continue with a project even if the team breaks up. The efforts of non owners to enhance productivity may then be devalued, but are typically not wholly lost on the project. This weakens the bargaining power of the non owner, considerably enlarging the circumstances under which outside options are consistent with ownership motivating. In addition, our analysis identifies the possibility that when the right agent owns not only do they put more effort into the enterprise, so does everyone else.

This paper extends the q-theory to include the possibility that costs associated with the risk of insolvency affect the firm's investment decisions. Using aggregate data for the UK business sector, the model is estimated both as a structural equation and in a less restrictive dynamic form which also allows for mis-measurement of Tobin's q by average q. The paper finds clear evidence that aggregate investment is influenced by the risk of insolvency.

abstract: In their empirical analysis of Real Business Cycle models for the UK, Holland and Scott (1998) find that they cannot reject the proposition that movements in output are largely determined by 'productivity shocks' which are independent of demand side variables, such as interest rates. In this note we extend their work to allow for the impact of financial liberalisation and credit availability. We find that credit availability has had a significant impact on movements in output, and that, when these effects are controlled for, monetary policy variables, including interest rates, also cause output. This is consistent with the conventional view that demand-expansion was the cause of the boom of the late 1980s and appears to reject a RBC interpretation of output movements.

length: 32 pages
abstract: The Fiscal Stability Pact for EMU suggests that constraints on fiscal policy are thought by policy makers to be necessary to ensure that the independent European central bank can control inflation. In this paper we examine the interrelationship between monetary and fiscal policy when both follow simple rules. We identify two stable policy regimes. In the 'active' regime, defined as a monetary policy that seeks to raise real interest rates in response to excess inflation, a self-stabilising fiscal policy is required to ensure model stability. In the corresponding 'passive' regime, a fiscal policy which does not, by itself, ensure fiscal solvency constrains monetary policy to be relatively 'passive'. The precise nature of these constraints depends upon the importance of money and the degree to which the economy deviates from Ricardian Equivalence. We then present simulations which analyse the impact of differing degrees of policy activism in the face of shocks. Our conclusion is that the central bank does not need to seek, on this account, the degree of debt stabilisation that appears to be implied by the fiscal stability pact.

It is found that when heteroscedasticity exists correcting for it leads not only to a substantial improvement of the statistical properties of estimators but also to improved efficiency and ranking measures. On the other hand correcting for heteroscedasticity when there is none has serious adverse results. Hence, there is a need for testing for heteroscedasticity and if there is any the appropriate correction should be made.

abstract: There is a widespread concern that a greater mobility of individuals can undermine any attempt to redistribute income at the local level. In this paper we derive the equilibrium level of redistribution when both the rich and the poor are mobile (although in different degrees) and when each jurisdiction chooses its redistributive policy by majority voting. This leads to a fundamental interaction whereby the policy choices of jurisdictions determine who they attract, and who they attract determines their policy choices. Our main findings are twofold. First, we show that a greater mobility of the poor can increase the equilibrium amount of redistribution. Second, we find that some jurisdictions can be stuck in equilibrium on the RwrongS side of their Laffer curve. The reason is that the poor are in a majority in these jurisdictions and they oppose to a potentially Pareto improving tax reduction because it would attract the rich and shift the majority.

Title: The Targeting of Social Security: a Tax Reform Approach.
Author-Name: Hindriks, J.
Keywords: SOCIAL SECURITY ; TAXATION ; TESTING
Length: 14 pages
Abstract: Income-based targeting (or means-testing) reduces social security benefits as income rises. This form of targeting entails a well-known incentive distortion; the prospect for the recipients of losing part of their benefits if they were to earn more can deter them to work harder. In this paper, we argue that targeting is more than a simple redistribution device that takes from the rich to give to the poor. The question involves starting from a particular tax-transfer scheme in force, and asking whether everybody would like to depart from it. Adopting a general environment, we derive simple conditions under which there exist such directions of change and we identify these directions. Specializing further the model and using numerical calculations we estimate the effects of inequality and tax evasion on the desirability of targeting.

Title: Income Tax Compliance: the No-Commitment Game.

Keywords: TAXATION ; INCOME ; ASYMETRIC INFORMATION
Length: 27 pages
Abstract: We consider a tax enforcement game in which the fiscal authority cannot pre-commit to an inspection policy and its interaction with the taxpayer is modelled as a signalling game. We extend earlier work by allowing for imperfect auditing, non-linear taxation and non-linear penalties. Using the incentive compatibility approach in signalling games (Mailath, 1987) and making explicit out-of-equilibrium beliefs, we demonstrate that the separating equilibrium is the only equilibrium of this game. As for characterisation, we show that the game has a simple solution which displays a constant level of non-compliance, constant audit rates and a progressive bias in the sense that the distribution of true liabilities Lorenz-dominates the distribution of effective tax payments. We also study the impact on the equilibrium outcome of small changes in taxation, penalty, auditing quality and cost of audit. Lastly, we allow for the possibility that the taxpayer is intrinsically honest with some probability and show that a small change in this probability has significant effects on reporting behaviour, audit policy and expected revenue.

Author-Name: Hindriks, J.
Keywords: TAXATION ; PUBLIC GOODS ; FISCAL POLICY
Length: 33 pages
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to analyse the role of evasion possibilities as a determinant of the general structure of commodity and income taxes and of public goods supply. A secondary objective is to provide a defence of differentiated commodity taxes based on the screening role of the purchases of certain goods. Formally, we solve the (constrained) Pareto-efficient commodity and income taxes when both types of taxes can be evaded. We find explicit solutions that readily incorporate the ease with which the transaction may be concealed. Many traditional issues are then (re-)considered, such as (i) the direct versus indirect tax controversy (proposition 1), (ii) uniform versus differential commodity taxes (proposition 2), (iii) regressivity versus progressivity (proposition 3) and (iv) decentralisation versus non-decentralisation of public good supply (proposition 4). We also formulate a modified Samuelson rule that accounts for the impact of tax evasion on the optimal provision of public goods.

Length: 20 pages
Abstract: This paper examines the intragenerational redistribution aspect of social security. The level of social security is determined by majority voting between individuals who differ (ex-ante) in their earning ability and life expectancy. Given incentive effects, the voting equilibrium depends on balancing the redistributive gains that social security provides to a majority against the efficiency costs of distorting economic behaviour. The impact of alternative benefit structures on the equilibrium level of social security is analysed. It is shown that the conventional wisdom stating that "tightening the link" between benefits and contributions will reduce the distortionary effect of social security does not survive the introduction of political economy considerations. We also show that the introduction of means-testing does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the size of social security. The impact on the equilibrium level of social security of a correlation between productivity and the probability of receiving benefits is also analysed.

The main model is characterised by risk of breakdown after the agreement on the first issue, transmission of delays between the negotiations over the two issues, and alternating offer (both after a rejection and an acceptance). Alternative models also are analysed to highlight the complex interplay of forces in the bargaining process over different issues.

Author-Name: Driver, R.L.
Author-Name: Wren-Lewis, S.
Keywords: EXCHANGE RATE ; TESTS ; ECONOMICS
Length: 37 pages
Abstract: The Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate (FEER) method of calculating an equilibrium real exchange rate is the most widely used alternative to PPP. This paper presents the first comprehensive historical test of FEER calculations for six major economies, using estimates for the last twenty years. We focus on unit root and cointegration techniques both at the individual country level and jointly using panel based estimation. Specifically, we test whether real exchange rates cointegrate with time series for the FEER with a coefficient of unity, so that the difference between the FEER and the real exchange rate is stationary. Even at an individual country level, the results provide support for the FEER, particularly in Canada, the UK and Germany. Panel unit root tests suggest that the real exchange rate and FEER cointegrate. Overall the results suggest that, with the possible exception of the US, the FEER approach represents an improvement over PPP in explaining medium to long term trends in the real exchange rates of the major industrialised countries.

Title: Evaluating Alternative Exchange Rate Regimes: Time Consistency, Inertia and the Identification of Shocks in a New Keynesian Model.
Author-Name: Driver, R.L.
Keywords: EXCHANGE RATE ; DEMAND ; SUPPLY ; MODELS
Length: 48 pages
Abstract: An ability to adequately assess the functioning of exchange rate regimes is crucial. Such an assessment will be based on a priori beliefs about how different regimes react to shocks and therefore which regime will be appropriate for a given economy. This paper contributes to this literature by examining how a wide variety of potential exchange rate regimes operate in the face of demand and supply shocks. The results show that the choice of exchange rate regime can significantly affect the transmission mechanism, particularly for supply shocks. This therefore has important implications for any methodology which uses VAR decompositions to judge the compatibility of economies to participate in fixed exchange rate regimes. In particular, when preexisting differences in exchange rate regimes are not accounted for, the results may be highly misleading. The constraint that policies are time consistent plays a significant role in determining the welfare costs associated with different regimes, particularly for supply shocks where a free float no longer dominates possible alternatives. Another important aspect is the degree of nominal inertia, which has a strong bearing on the costs associated with each regime. In particular, the reduction in the welfare loss if nominal inertia falls is significantly greater for EMU.

Title: Trade Flows and Spatial Effects: The Gravity Model Revisited.
Author-Name: Porojan, A.
Keywords: TRADE ; ECONOMETRICS ; SPATIAL ANALYSIS
Length: 24 pages
Abstract: The paper revisits the popular gravity model of trade in the light of the increasingly acknowledged findings of spatial econometrics and interprets the results in view of some recent theoretical developments from the economic literature that contribute to its foundation. When the inherent spatial effects are explicitly taken into account, the magnitude of the estimated parameters changes considerably and, with it, the measures on the predicted trade flows. This result is illustrated on the case of predicted trade flows between the EU and some of its potential members.

Keywords: INVESTMENTS ; TRADE ; PRODUCTION
Length: 48 pages
Abstract: This paper outlines recent themes in the literature on foreign direct investment with particular reference to the links between foreign investment and trade. A discussion of the research into the recent surge of foreign direct investment is also presented. The paper emphasises the need for appropriate data to test recent theoretical developments with special attention paid to the aggregation of the data in order to distinguish between vertical and horizontal foreign direct investment and, at the product level, to distinguish between trade in final and intermediate goods. Moreover, the country coverage of empirical studies needs to be extended, in particular to include FDI from European Union countries.

Length: 26 pages
Abstract: We introduce time-dependent rewards into a general framework for analyzing innovative activity among firms with sunk costs of R&D. When firms are identical, innovation is delayed by an increase in the number of firms or a decrease in the size of the reward. When one firm has higher profit potential, it is more likely to innovate first. Our framework generalizes an all-pay auction; however, we show that under conditions there is qualitatively different equilibrium behavior.

Length: 27 pages
Abstract: This paper reverses the standard conclusion that asymmetric information plus competition results in insufficient insurance provision. Risk-tolerant individuals take few precautions and are disinclined to insure, but are drawn into a pooling equilibrium by the low premiums created by the presence of safer, more risk-averse types. Taxing insurance drives out the reckless clients, allowing a strict Pareto gain. This result depends on administrative costs in processing claims and issuing policies, as does the novel finding of a pure-strategy, partial-pooling, sub-game-perfect, Nash equilibrium in the insurance market.

Keywords: WORKERS ; WAGES ; CONTRACTS
Length: 24 pages
Abstract: The analysis of the determination of union membership has typically met difficulties with the fact that union membership is not individually rational and free-riding is the dominant strategy. We assume that workers differ in their reservation wages and hence in their preferred choice of contract, so preventing free-riding on the contract choice of others. This implies that joining a union is equivalent to buying a vote on the contract and provides an individual incentive to join the union. An equilibrium trade union membership is characterized in which membership is taken up by those with relatively "extreme" tastes. The union achieves a centralist objective even though no member precisely supports such a view.

Length: 19 pages
Abstract: The decision of a committee is determined jointly by the voting process it adopts and the composition of its membership. The paper analyses the process through which committee members emerge from the eligible population and traces the consequences of this for the decisions of the committee. It is shown that the equilibrium committee will be composed of representatives from the extremes of the taste distribution. These extremes balance each other and the committee reaches a moderate decision. However, this mutual negation by the extremes is a socially wasteful use of time. Data from the UK House of Lords is used to illustrate these results.

Length: 28 pages
Abstract: In developed countries, car use is one of the most significant contributors to air pollution. It is also a notable fact that larger, heavier cars consume more fuel and hence contribute more to pollution. This observation has lead to policy proposals to structure taxation to encourage the use of smaller, lighter cars. A model of vertical product differentiation is used to explain why different types of car are chosen. The correct policy response to the externality problem is then investigated using this model. It is shown that there are reasons why the standard policy response may be flawed and that it may even be optimal to subsidize large cars at the expense of small. A comparison of policies reveals that the relative merits of differentiated annual taxes and differentiated fuel taxes are dependent on the degree of income inequality.

Title: Strong Rules for Detecting the Number of Breaks in a Time Series.
Author-Name: Altissimo, F.
Author-Name: Corradi, V.
Keywords: TESTS ; TIME SERIES ; BEHAVIOUR
Length: 43 pages
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for detecting the number of structural breaks in a time series when estimation of the breaks is performed one at the time. We consider the case of shifts in the mean of a possibly nonlinear process, allowing for dependent and heterogeneous observations. This is accomplished through a simple, sequential, almost sure rule ensuring that, in large samples, both the probabilities of overestimating and underestimating the number of breaks are zero. A new estimator for the long run variance which is consistent also in the presence of neglected breaks is proposed. The finite sample behavior is investigated via a simulation exercise. The sequential procedure, applied to the weekly Eurodollar interest rate, detects multiple breaks over the period 1973-1995.

Title: A Consistent Test for Nonlinear Out of Sample Predictive Accuracy.
Author-Name: Corradi, V.
Author-Name: Swanson, N.R.
Keywords: TESTS ; MODELS ; MATHEMATICS
Length: 27 pages
Abstract: In this paper, we draw on both the consistent specification testing and the predictive ability testing literatures and propose a test for predictive accuracy which is consistent against generic nonlinear alternatives. Broadly speaking, given a particular reference model, assume that the objective is to test whether there exists any alternative model, among an infinite number of alternatives, that has better predictive accuracy than the reference model, for a given loss function. A typical example is the case in which the reference model is a simple autoregressive model and the objective is to check whether a more accurate forecasting model can be constructed by including possibly unknown (non)linear functions of the past of the process or of the past of some other process(es). We propose a statistic which is similar in spirit to that of White (2000), although our approach differs from his as we allow for an infinite number of competing models that may be nested. In addition, we allow for non vanishing parameter estimation error. In order to construct valid asymptotic critical values, we implement a conditional p-value procedure which extends the work of Inoue (1999) by allowing for non vanishing parameter estimation error.

Title: Bounds for Inference with Nuisance Parameters Present only under the Alternative.
Author-Name: Altissimo, F.
Author-Name: Corradi, V.
Keywords: STATISTICS ; BEHAVIOUR ; UNEMPLOYMENT
Length: 40 pages
Abstract: In hypothesis testing with nuisance parameters present only under the alternative two issues typically arise: (i) critical values are date dependent and so cannot be tabulated; (ii) we need to choose a functional over the nuisance parameter space. We address the first issue by providing easily computable bounds for the case of dependent and heterogeneous observations. We tackle the second issue by suggesting a weighted average statistic with weights given by the (quasi) likelihood over the nuisance parameter space. The small sample behavior of our procedure is analyzed via few Monte Carlo simulations; we consider conditional moment tests and tests for nonlinearities in the SETAR model. For samples of 200-400 observations, the behavior of the suggested weighted average statistic is rather satisfactory. An empirical illustration using date on U.S. male unemployment is provided.

Title: Why Banks Should Keep Secrets.
Author-Name: Kaplan, T.R.
Keywords: CONTRACTS ; INFORMATION ; BANKS
Length: 20 pages
Abstract: We show that it is sometimes efficient for a bank to commit to a policy that keeps information about its risky assets private. Our model, based upon Diamond-Dybvig [1983], has the feature that banks acquire information about their risky assets before depositors acquire it. Banks have the option of using contracts where the middle-period return on deposits is contingent on this information, but by doing so they must also reveal the information. We derive the conditions on depositors' preferences and bankers' technology for which banks would prefer to keep information secret even though they must then use non-contingent deposit contracts.

Abstract: Existing models of self-fulfilling crises fail to explain both the onset and the abruptness of recent currency attacks. In this apper we follow the suggestion by Myerson (1998) that in games with a very large number of players 'a more realistic model should admit some uncertainty about the number of players in the game.' In particular, we build a Large Poisson Currency Crises Game which turns out to be consistent with sudden attacks and unique equilibrium.

Abstract: In this paper we try shedding light on the two popular questions on spectrum licensing auctions: [1] whether any geographical synergies between licences can be detected, and if so, what would be possible alternatives and pros and cons thereof, and [2] whether the provision of entrants-only licences truly serve to protect new (hence less established) entrants and encourage their participation. Our empirical analysis on [1] is mixed and inconclusive, leaving some concerns on the broadly adopted auction mechanism that ignores any potential synergistic interlink between geographically adjacent licences. The Australian data also serves to cast a fresh doubt against [2], which we follow up by a simple theoretical discussion.

Keywords: SUPPLY ; STOCKS ; STRATEGIC PLANNING
Length: 22 pages
Abstract: A general model of two-period duopoly is set up to show how inventories can serve a strategic purpose, enabling the firm to commit to raise its latter-period output. The strategic effect of inventories depends on the convexity of the cost function, on the cost of storage, and on the slopes of each firm's individual supply schedules. Our analysis encompasses general up-sloping supply schedules, with horizontal Bertrand supply schedules and vertical Cournot supply schedules as the two polar cases, via one continuous parameter which has a straightforward one-to-one correspondence with what has been broadly known as the conjectural variation parameter. A closed form of the strategic inventories is then established for a parametrised two-period n-firm linear oligopoly, which can be treated as a user-friendly package for empirical estimation as well as for regulatory policy making.

Abstract: This paper formulates a new theory of financial intermediation and explains the general structure of credit markets. Borrowers without established credit histories have incentives to repudiate their debt obligations, and are therefore unable to issue debt directly. Banks exist in order to provide finance for this class of borrowers. Banks can curtail borrowers' incentives to default on debt by building a reputation for liquidating defaulters. However, over time, borrowers' concerns about reputation improve their incentives, such that they are able to issue debt directly.

Author-Name: Bijapur, M.
Keywords: CREDIT ; DEBT ; RISK
Length: 30 pages
Abstract: This paper analyzes the dynamics of firms' credit ratings, in the context of a multi-period moral hazard problem, in which borrowers have incentives to repudiate their debt obligations. Borrowers with short credit histories face the poorest incentives, and (depending on initial conditions) for these borrowers debt repayment can only be enforced by the threat of liquidation. However, over time if borrowers repay debt on all dates, they will establish a good credit history. This may improve their incentives, such that they will repay debt because they are concerned about their reputations for being a good credit risk, even if they face no threat of liquidation if they do default. The model generates predictions which explain two stylized observations on the dynamics of firms' credit ratings.

Title: Here's Something you Never Asked for, didn't Know Existed, and can't Easily Obtain: A Search Model of Gift Giving.
Author-Name: Ruffle, B.J.
Author-Name: Kaplan, T.R.
Keywords: WELFARE ECONOMICS ; INFORMATION ; GOODS
Length: 28 pages
Abstract: Gift giving is thought to be welfare decreasing. This claim rests on two key assumptions, namely, full information as to the whereabouts of all goods and the ability to reach the stores that contain desired goods costlessly. In this paper, we replace these two assumptions with the more realistic assumption of uncertainty about the location of goods. As a result, search costs ensue. In sharp contrast to existing economic models of gift giving, gifts in our model are given only when they enhance expected welfare, that is, the amount they save the receiver looking for the gift himself is higher than the expected price of unwanted gifts. The more difficult it is for the recipient to obtain the good he desires or the lower the price of this good, the more likely he is to receive it as a gift. Search costs affect not only the decision to give but also the choice of gift. We characterize the relationship between gift giving and the giverUs information about the recipient's preferences as well as her information about the gifts available in the economy. We use our model to explain a number of stylized facts about gift giving in modern and primitive societies.

Title:  Bootstrap Specification Tests with Dependent Observations and Parameter Estimation Error
Abstract: This paper introduces a parametric specification test for dissusion processes which is based on a bootstrap procedure that accounts for data dependence and parameter estimation error. The proposed bootstrap procedure additionally leads to straightforward generalizations of the conditional Kolmogorov test of Andrews (1997) and the conditional mean test of Whang (2000) to the case of dependent observations. The bootstrap hinges on a twofold extension of the Politis and Romano (1994) stationary bootstrap. First we provide an empirical process version of this bootstrap, and second, we account for parameter estimation error. One important feature of this new bootstrap is that one need not specify the conditional distribution given the entire history of the process when forming conditional Kolmogorov tests. Hence, the bootstrap, when used to extend Andrews (1997) conditional Kolmogorov test to the case of data dependence, allows for dynamic misspecification under both hypotheses. An example based on a version of the Cox, Ingersol and Ross square root process is outlined and related Monte Carlo experiments are carried out. These experiments suggest that the boostrap has excellent finite sample properties, even for samples as small as 500 observations when tests are formed using critical values constructed with as few as 100 bootstrap replications. .

Title: An OLG Model of Endogenous Growth and Ageing
Abstract: To study fully endogenous ageing alongside growth and their implications, this paper sets up an OLG economy in which the life expectancy of agents is endogenous. Agents are bearers of children, investors in education and producers and consumers of output. Retirement decision in the last period of life is also endogenous and, when retired, agents receive a pension that is nanced by a PAYG system. The model features a unique asymptotically stable steady state. Accordingly it supports a plethora of short and medium-run dynamic paths to a uniquely dened long-run equilibrium depending on the functional forms, parameters and initial conditions. The model is then calibrated and some comparative static experiments on the e
ect of policy variables changes are conducted.

Title:  Behind the cube rule: implications of, and evidence against a fractal electoral geography
Abstract: In 1909 Parker Smith showed that the ratio of seats won by the two major parties in Britain was close to the cube of the ratio of their votes. Taagepera and Shugart argue, wrongly, that a fractal electoral map implies this. In fact their premises imply that the seats ratio will be the votes ratio to the power of 3 , not 3. However, in the six countries we examine, the figure is between 2 and 3. This implies that the electoral map is nonfractal, political allegiances becoming less clustered as you move from a macro to a micro scale. Taking the U.K., we ask if this is due to the geographical pattern of income distribution, and find that this is even further away from fractality than is voting. This fits the well-known chameleon effect whereby poor (rich) people in rich (poor) constituencies vote as if richer (poorer) than they really are.

Title:  Strategic Advance Production
Abstract: Advance production serves as a means of quantity commitment. Therefore an oligopolist, unlike a monopolist, may have an incentive to invest in advance production in order to pre-empt its opponent(s) even when [i] it is technologically more costly than on-spot production, and [ii] it does not entitle the firm to Stackelberg leadership in the subsequent marketing stage. When  firms set quantities, such pre-emption acts as strategic substitutes between oligopolists. Namely, in a pure strategy subgame perfect equilibrium, some but not all firms may engage in advance production, whether the firms are a priori symmetric or not. More generally, a firm's incentive for advance production arises only if there is a quantity-setting opponent, irrespective of the firm's own strategic variable (i.e., price or quantity) and the characteristics of the concerned products (i.e., substitutes or complements).

Title: A Randomized Procedure for Choosing Data Transformation  
Abstract: Standard unit root and stationarity tests (see e.g. Dickey and Fuller (1979)) assume linearity under both the null and the alternative hypothesis. Violation of this linearity assumption can result
in severe size and power distortion, both in finite and large samples. Thus, it is reasonable to address the problem of data transformation before running a unit root test. In this paper we propose a
simple randomized procedure, coupled with sample conditioning, for choosing between levels and log-levels specifications in the presence of deterministic and/or stochastic trends. In particular, we
add a randomized component to a basic test statistic, proceed by conditioning on the sample, and show that for all samples except a set of measure zero, the statistic has a X2 limiting distribution
under the null hypothesis (log linearity), while it diverges under the alternative hypothesis (level linearity). Once we have chosen the proper data transformation, we remain with the standard
problem of testing for a unit root, either in levels or in logs. Monte Carlo findings suggest that the proposed test has good finite sample properties for samples of at least 300 observations. In
addition, an examination of the King, Plosser, Stock and Watson (1991) data set is carried out, and evidence in favor of using logged data is provided.

Title:  On the Evolutionary Selection of Nash Equilibrium
 Components
Abstract: It is well known for the common multi-population evolutionary dynamics applied to normal form games that a pure strategy combination is asymptotically stable if
and only if it is a strict equilibrium point. We extend this result to sets as follows. For certain regular selection dynamics every connected and closed asymptotically
stable set of rest points containing a pure strategy combination is a strict equilibrium set and hence a Nash equilibrium component. A converse statement holds for two
person games, for convex strict equilibrium sets and for the standard replicator dynamic.

Title:  The Regional Policy of the European Union and the Enlargement Process to Central and Eastern European Countries
Abstract: The successive enlargement processes of the European Union have implied reforms in Regional Policy. Since the Single European Act (1987), Europe has got a structural policy mainly focused on regions whose development is lagging behind. The accession of CEECs will mean an extraordinary increase in regional development disparities. However, the current EU Regional Policy is addressed to deal with such a kind of development lags. Competition in a large market combined with regional development policy of the EU is a successful policy mix to boost growth of CEECs in the framework of an open market economy. The own success of regional policy in current objective 1 regions will led to an important reduction of assisted population. The financial perspectives approved in the
Berlin Summit (March 1999) provides enough financial space to assist 90% of population in CEECs and 75% of current population under objective 1. The main challenge involved in the successful extension of EU Regional Policy to CEECs lies in the field of management capabilities and administration reforms that must be carried out in these countries.

Title:  Worker Discretion and Misallocation of Talent within Firms
Abstract: We develop a theory of worker discretion over task choice within a firm. Increasing the workers discretion has a trade-off between the gains from workers
using private information about their abilities, and the costs from adverse selection within the firm due to workers herding into prestigious tasks. The theory leads
to the result that, in line with the Peter Principle, misallocation of talent within firms takes the form of too many workers undertaking tasks with a high return to
ability. Moreover we find that the degree of misallocation of talent is decreasing in the degree of discretion given to workers.

Title: All-Pay Auctions with Variable Rewards
Abstract: We study all-pay auctions with variable rewards under incomplete information. In standard models, a reward depends on a bidder!s privately known type; however, in our model it is also a function of his bid. We show that in such models there is a potential for paradoxical behavior where a reduction in the rewards or an increase in costs may increase the expected sum of bids or alternatively the expected highest bid

Title: A Note on Revenue Effects of Asymmetry in Private-Value Auctions
Abstract: We formulate a way to study whether the asymmetry of buyers (in the sense of having different prior probability distributions of valuations) is helpful to the seller in private-value auctions (asked first by Cantillon [2001]). In our proposed formulation, this question corresponds to two important questions previously asked: Does a first-price auction have higher revenue than a second-price auction when buyers have asymmetric distributions (asked by Maskin and Riley[2000])? And does a seller enhance revenue by releasing information (asked by Milgrom and Weber[1982])? This is shown by constructing two Harsanyi games of incomplete information each having the same ex-ante distribution of valuations but in one beliefs are symmetric while in the other beliefs are sometimes asymmetric. Our main result is that answers to all three questions coincide when values are independent and are related when values are affiliated.

Title: Political Uncertainty and Policy Innovation
Abstract: Conventional wisdom has it that outside sources of information enhance the capability of political institutions to separate selfish from benevolent incumbents. This paper investigates, in the presence of innovative public policies whose outcomes are uncertain, the role of outside information and shows that it is more involved than typically thought. While it is true that enhanced information helps in separating politicians, it also creates an externality that reduces the incentives to experiment with innovative public policies.

Title: Tax competition in federations and the welfare consequences of decentralization
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of intensified tax competition within federal systems characterized by the presence of both horizontal tax externalities between the states and vertical tax externalities between states and federal government. It shows that although these point in opposite directions (horizontal towards state taxes that are too low, vertical towards state taxes that are too high), leaving the net outcome unclear, intensified tax competition always worsens their combined effect. That is, intensified lower-level tax competitionin the form of an increase in the number of lower-level jurisdictionsis sure to reduce welfare, but this is not because, as usually supposed, it makes excessively low state taxes even lower; rather, it is welfare-reducing either for that reason or because it makes excessively high state taxes even higher.

Title: Dividing the Indivisible: Procedures for Allocating Cabinet Ministries to Political Parties in a Parliamentary System
Abstract: Political parties in Northern Ireland recently used a divisor method of apportionment to choose, in sequence, ten cabinet ministries. If the parties have complete information about each others' preferences, we show that it may not be rational for them to act sincerely by choosing their most-preferred ministry that is available.
One consequence of acting sophisticatedly is that the resulting allocation may not be Pareto-optimal, making all the parties worse off. Another is nonmonotonictychoosing earlier may hurt rather than help a party. We introduce a mechanism that combines sequential choices with a structured form of trading that results in sincere choices for two parties. Although there are difficulties in extending this mechanism to more than two parties, other approaches are explored, such as permitting parties to making consecutive choices not prescribed by an apportionment method. But certain problems, such as eliminating envy, remain.

Title: Taylor Rules in the Open Economy
Abstract: Taylor rules which link short-term interest rates to fluctuations in inflation and output, have been shown to be a good guide (both positively and normatively) to the conduct of monetary policy. As a result they have been used extensively to model policy in the context of both closed and open economy models. A key question that arises when analysing the conduct of such policy rules in the open economy case is whether the relevant measure of inflation is the growth in output prices or consumer prices. In this paper, we show that embedding a rule specified in terms of output price inflation into a benchmark two-country model confirms the existing result that local stability requires that the response of nominal interest rates to excess inflation should be such that real interest rates rise (the Taylor Principle), but this requirement may be partially offset by raising the interest rate response to increases in the output gap. However, all the conventional results do not hold when we replace output price inflation with consumer price inflation. In this case, Taylor rules which satisfy the Taylor principle will not support a unique rational expectations path for prices and other macroeconomic variables in response to specific shocks. Our results suggest that adoption of consumer price based Taylor rules might be chronically destabilising.

Title: The Influence of globalization on taxes and social policy - an empirical enalysis for OECD countries
Abstract: Using panel regression for the period 1970-2000 the paper analyzes whether globalization has influenced the OECD countries' social and overall spending as well as their implicit tax rates on labor, consumption and capital. Accounting for potential endogeneity of the regressors, the results show that globalization (measured by an index covering 23 variables) did not decrease the leeway for independent economic policy. Globalization even increased implicit tax rates on capital  a result that is mainly driven by economic integration. Depending on the method of estimation, increasing social integration also plays a role, while political integration does not matter for economic policy.

Title: The Practice of Zakat: An Empirical Examination of Four Gulf Countries
Abstract: As one of the cornerstones of Islamic economics, zakat has been given little attention in Islamic economics literature. Both theoretical and empirical studies are scarce, and thus this paper is an attempt to initiate discussion on the realities of the practice of zakat in the Muslim world. It is hoped that this will draw attention to the need to investigate the practice of zakat throughout the world. Some empirical results on a number of practical aspects of zakat are provided. The discussion is based on a collection of perception data from respondents in four Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries regarding the evaluation, collection and payment of zakat.

Title: Forecasting Value at Risk in Emerging Arab Stock Markets
Abstract: The economic and political instability of most of the Arab countries may lead to the assumption that Arab stock markets are riskier and less predictable than stock markets in developed countries. Value at Risk (VaR) measures risk exposure at a given probability level and is very important for risk management. In this paper extreme value theory with volatility updating is used to forecast Value at Risk in three emerging Arab stock markets and the US stock market. Several forecast accuracy criteria are used to compare forecast performance in the four stock markets, including a suggested asymmetric forecast criterion. The various criteria used in this paper suggest that Arab stock markets are less risky than the US stock market.

Title: Tax Competition and Politics: Double-Edged Incentives Revisited
Abstract: We re-examine, from a political economy perspective, the standard view that higher capital mobility results in lower capital taxes - a view, in fact, that is not confirmed by the available empirical evidence. We show that when a small economy is opened to capital mobility, the change of incidence of a tax on capital - from capital owners to owners of the immobile factor - may interact in such a way with political decision-making so as to cause a rise in the equilibrium tax. This can happen whether or not the fixed factor (labour) can be taxed.

Title: Indeterminacy, intergenerational redistribution, endogenous longevity and human capital accumulation
Abstract: This paper sets up an OLG economy with endogenous life expectancy to study how fiscal policy that redistributes between generations can open the door to sunspot equilibria. Agents invest independently in their own human capital, produce and consume output, and receive a pension upon retirement. The model produces an expectations coordination problem that can explain significant differences in growth paths followed by otherwise identical countries. In particular, we show that our economy may be characterised by local indeterminacy of dynamic equilibria, and hence feature fluctuations which are driven by extrinsic uncertainty.

Title: The Optimal Rewards in Contests
Abstract: We study all-pay contests under incomplete information where the reward is a function of the contestant's type and also of his effort. We analyze the optimal reward for the designer when the reward is either multiplicatively separable or additively separable in effort and type. In the multiplicatively separable environment the optimal reward is always positive while in the additively separable environment it may also be negative. In both environments, depending on the designer's utility, the optimal reward may either increase or decrease in the contestants' effort. Finally, in both environments, the designer's payoff depends only upon the expected value of the effort-dependent rewards and not the number of rewards.

Title: It's My Turn . . . Please, After You: An Experimental Study of Cooperation and Social Conventions
Abstract: We introduce a class of two-player cooperation games where each player faces a binary decision, enter or exit. These games have a unique Nash equilibrium of entry. However, entry imposes a large enough negative externality on the other player such that the unique social optimum involves the player with the higher value to entry entering and the other player exiting. When the game is repeated and players' values to entry are private, cooperation admits the form of either taking turns entering or using a cuto? strategy and entering only for high private values of entry. Even with conditions that provide opportunities for unnoticed or non-punishable cheating, our empirical analysis including a simple strategy inference technique reveals that the Nash-equilibrium strategy is never the modal choice. In fact, most subjects employ the socially optimal symmetric cuto? strategy. These games capture the nature of cooperation in many economic and social situations such as bidding rings in auctions, competition for market share, labor supply decisions in the face of excess supply, queuing in line and courtship.

Title: On extended liability in a model of adverse selection
Abstract: We consider a model where a judgment-proof firm needs finance to realize a project. This project might cause an environmental hazard with a probability that is the private knowledge of the firm. Thus there is asymmetric information with respect to the environmental riskiness of the project. We consider the implications of a simple joint and strict liability rule on the lender and the firm where, in case of a damage, the lender is responsible for that part of the liability which the judgment-proof firm cannot pay. We use a weighted version of the neutral bargaining solution (Myerson 1983 / 1984) to determine the financial contract between the lender and the firm. In the given model we show that either full or a punitive liability is optimal.

Title: Imperfect Competition, Indirect Tax Harmonization and Public Goods.
Abstract: In a recent contribution Keen, Lahiri and Raimondos-Mller (2002) (European Economic Review, 46, 1559-1568), in a model of imperfect competition with no revenue e?ects, show that tax harmonization under the destination principle always makes one country better o? and maybe Pareto-improving, whereas under the origin principle, and under certain circumstances, it leads to a strict Pareto-worsening. This paper shows that the welfare implications of (destination- and origin-based) tax harmonization are, in general, indeterminate when public goods are present. A consequence of this is that the choice of the tax principle and the harmonization of tax rates across countries can be considered in isolation.

Title: Joining the 'Europe' and Shrinking the Pound: Britain's Single Currency Debate of the Late 1860s.
Abstract: Though a Royal Commission had rejected Britain joining the Latin Monetary Union, Robert Lowe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said he would recommend membership provided three conditions were satisfied. As these included a general adherence to the gold standard, nothing further came of it. But meanwhile there had been a complex public discussion of the subject, and the related topic of shrinking the pound coin so it weighed the same as the 25-france piece. The debate shed much light on the contemporary state of value and monetary theory, and those who supported the changes had much the best of it.

Title: Market distortions and corporate governance.
Abstract:This paper studies corporate governance when a firm operates in imperfect markets. We derive firms' decisions from utility maximisation by individuals. This reduces the usual monopoly distortion. Corporate governance can effect the equilibrium in the product (or input) markets. This enables us to endogenise the objective function of the firm. If the firm cannot commit not to change its constitution, we find a Coase-like result where all market power is lost in the limit. We present a more abstract model of governance in the presence of market distortions and discuss its implications for the governance of universities.

Title: Ambiguity and Social Interaction
Abstract: We present a non-technical account of ambiguity in strategic games and show how it may be applied to economics and social sciences. Optimistic and pessimistic responses to ambiguity are formally modelled. We show that pessimism has the e?ect of increasing (decreasing) equilibrium prices under Cournot (Bertrand) competition. In addition the e?ects of ambiguity on peace-making are examined. It is shown that ambiguity may select equilibria in coordination games with multiple equilibria. Some comparative statics results are derived for the impact of ambiguity in games with strategic complements.

Title: How Do Institutions Affect Corruption and the Shadow Economy
Abstract: This paper analyzes a simple model that captures the relationship between institutional quality, the shadow economy and corruption. It shows that an improvement in institutional quality reduces the shadow economy and a?ects the corruption market. The exact relationship between corruption and institutional quality is, however, ambiguous and depends on the relative e?ectiveness of the institutional quality in the shadow and corruption markets. The predictions of the model are empirically testedby means of Structural Equation Modelling that treats the shadow economy and the corruption market as latent variablesusing data from OECD countries. The results show that an improvement in institutional quality reduces the shadow economy directly and corruption both directly and indirectly (through its e?ect on the shadow market).

Title: Influence of aggregation and measurement scale on ranking a compromise alternative in AHP
Abstract: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the most popular multi-attribute decision aid methods. However, results depend on the preference measurement sacle and the aggregation technique used. In this paper, we describe a decision problem with an inherent trade-off between two criteria. A decision-maker has to choose among three alternatives: two extremes and one "compromise". Six different measurement scales described previously in the literature and the new proposed logarithmic scale are considered for applying the additive and the multiplicative AHP. The results are compared with the standard consumer choice theory. The geometric and power scales offer no chance (for the additive AHP) and very few chances (for the multiplicative AHP) for a compromise to be selected. The logarithmic scale used with the multiplicative AHP is the most in agreement with the consumer choice theory.

Title: On the Incentives to Experiment in Federations
Abstract: Conventional wisdom has it that policy innovation is better promoted in a federal rather than in a unitary system. Recent research, however, has provided theoretical evidence to the contrary: a multi-jurisdictional system is characterizeddue to the existence of a horizontal information externalityby under-provision of policy innovation. This paper presents a simple model that introduces political competition for federal o?ce and emphasizes that such competition plays an important role in shaping the incentives for experimentation. For, in this case, political actors use the innovative policies to signal ability to the electorate. This e?ect may o?set the e?ect that arises from the incentive to free ride, and so a federal system may generate more innovation than a unitary one.

Title: Incentives for Motivated Agents under an Administrative Constraint
Abstract: Consider an agent who has an expertise in producing a non-marketable good. This good is valued by a single principal, and there is a veri able measure of the agent's performance. Crucially, the agent is intrinsically motivated, due to `warm glow altruism'. In addition, the agent's budget, which is controlled by the principal, must not be less than the monetary performance-cost faced by the agent. This gives rise to a limited-liability constraint. It also restricts the agent's ability to under-report costs. In such environment, we determine the link between the agent's budget and performance. Our results come in contrast to the received solution of the principal-agent problem, and to most in the literature on mission-motivated organisations and public services provision.

Title: Complementarities and Macroeconomics: Poisson Games
Abstract: In many situations in macroeconomics strategic complementarities arise, and agents face a coordination problem. An important issue, from both a theoretical and a policy perspective, is equilibrium uniqueness. We contribute to this literature by focusing on the macroeconomic aspect of the problem: the number of potential innovators, speculators e.t.c. is large. In particular, we follow Myerson (1998, 2000) that in large games a more realistic model should admit some uncertainty about the number of players in the game. In more detail, we model the coordination problem as a Poisson game, and investigate the conditions under which unique equilibrium selection is obtained.

Title: Seignorage and Capital Taxation: Tax Competition Revisited
Abstract: We re-examine the standard view that capital taxes are too low when capital is mobile across tax jurisdictions. We do so by emphasising a previously neglected implication of non-cooperative capital tax setting in a world with national currencies. Namely, capital taxes also affect foreign seignorage. This horizontal externality may lead, ceteris paribus, to too high national capital taxes, and may more than o set the usual effects of tax competition. In this case, and contrary to conventional wisdom, national capital taxes will be too high. Conditions under which the latter is indeed the case are derived and discussed.

Title: Externalities, Monopoly and the Objective Function of the Firm
Abstract: This paper provides a theory of general equilibrium with externalities and/or monopoly. We assume that the firm's decisions are based on the preferences of shareholders and/or other stakeholders. Under these assumptions, a firm will produce fewer negative externalities than the comparable profit maximizing firm. In the absence of externalities, equilibrium with a monopoly will be Pareto efficient if the firm can price discriminate. The equilibrium can be implemented by a 2-part tariff.

Title: Optimism and Pessimism in Games.
Abstract:This paper considers the impact of ambiguity in strategic situations. It extends the earlier literature by allowing for optimistic responses to ambiguity. Ambiguity is modelled by CEU preferences. We study comparative statics of changes in ambiguity-attitude in games with strategic complements or substitutes. This gives a precise statement of the impact of ambiguity on economic behaviour. We also the possibility that players may be overconfident in the sense of over-estimating the probability of favourable outcomes. This has a similar effect of increasing equilibrium strategies in games of strategic complements, Finally we consider RDEU preferences.

Title: Differentiating Ambiguity: A Comment.
Abstract: In Ghirardato, Macheroni and MArcinaccri (GMM) propose a method for distinguishing between percieved ambiguity and the decision-maker's reaction to it. They study a general class of preferences which includes CEU and a-MEU and axiomatise a subclass of a-MEU preferences. We show that for Hurwicz preferences the proposed measure of ambiguity depends on parameters which intuitively reflect ambiguity-attitude. Furthermore, any a-MEU preferences which satisfy the CEU axioms, satisfy GMM's axioms if and only if a = 0 or 1, that is, the capacity must be convex or concave.

Title: Updating Choquet Beliefs.
Abstract: We apply Piress coherence property between unconditional and conditional preferences that admit a CEU representation. In conjunction with consequentialism (only those outcomes on states which are still possible can matter for conditional preference) this implies that the conditional preference may be obtained from the unconditional preference by taking the Full Bayesian Update of the capacity.
Attitudes towards sequential versus simultaneous resolution of uncertainty for a simple bet are analyzed. We show that for a class of recursive CEU preferences which exhibit both optimism and pessimism, a 'good-news' signal is preferred to no signal which is preferred to a 'bad-news' signal.

Title: Asymmetry of Shocks and Convergence in Selected Asean Countries: A Dynamic Analysis
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate whether structural shocks among ASEAN countries are becoming more symmetrical over time, thus indicating whether this region is becoming better prepared to introduce a common monetary policy. For that purpose a dynamic space-state model that complements the conventional Structural VAR models used in the existing literature was estimated by using the Kalman filter so that the evolution of the degree of shock symmetry and, therefore, the evolution in the degree of convergence could be identified over time, distinguishing between a country's convergence with a regional partner and a more general trend of convergence with the rest of the world.The results showed that in the majority of cases there has been an increase in the degree of convergence of demand shocks in recent years. More importantly, it also showed an increase in divergence in supply shocks for most cases since the beginning of the 90's even when taking into account the Asian Financial Crisis. This is especially true for the periphery countries suggesting that the Philippines and Thailand are not only not converging but actually diverging from the core group. These results have important implications for the prospects of the creation of a common monetary policy in the region.

Title: On the Relationship between the Investment-Cashflow Sensitivity and the Degree of Financing Constraints
Abstract: We investigate whether the investment-cash flow sensitivity is monotonic in the degree of financing constraints. By using a large panel of publicly traded non-financial U.K. firms, we show that the investment-cash flow sensitivity is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing in the most common proxies of financing constraints; on the contrary, an inverse U-shaped relationship is observed. Robustness exercises show that the parameter of interest displays, to some extent, a monotonic behavior with respect to size only; however, in contrast with much of the relevant literature, it is found to be greater for larger firms, whose characteristics would hardly lead the researcher to classify them as more financially constrained. If taken as a whole, our findings suggest that higher investment-cash flow sensitivities may hardly be used as evidence of greater financial constraints.

Title: Five-Equation Macroeconomics A Simple View of the Interactions Between Fiscal Policy and Monetary Policy
Abstract: This paper studies the interactions of fiscal and monetary policy when they stabilise a single economy against shocks in a dynamic setting. We assume that fiscal and monetary policies both stabilise the economy only by causing changes to aggregate demand. Our findings are as follows. If the both policymakers are benevolent, then the best outcome is achieved when the fiscal authority allows monetary policy to perform nearly all of the burden of stabilising the economy. If the monetary authorities are benevolent, but the fiscal authorities have distorted objectives, then a Nash equilibrium will result in large welfare losses: unilateral efforts by each authority to stabilise the economy will result in a rapid accumulation of public debt. However, if the monetary authorities are benevolent and the fiscal authorities have distorted objectives, but there is a regime of fiscal leadership, then the outcome will be very nearly as good as it is in the regime in which both policymakers are benevolent.

Title: Optimal Fiscal Policy Rules in a Monetary Union
Abstract: This paper investigates the importance of ?scal policy in providing macroeconomic stabilisation in a monetary union. We use a microfounded New Keynesian model of a monetary union which incorporates persistence in in?ation and non-Ricardian consumers, and derive optimal simple rules for ?scal authorities. We ?nd that ?scal policy can play an important role in reacting to in?ation, output and the terms of trade, but that not much is lost if national ?scal policy is restricted to react, on the one hand, to national di?erences in in?ation and, on the other hand, to either national di?erences in output or changes in the terms of trade. However, welfare is reduced if national ?scal policy responds only to output, ignoring in?ation.

Title: A Comparison of National Saving Rates in the UK, US and Italy
Abstract: We develop the approach of Gokhale et al. (1996), based on the life-cycle model of savings, to decompose the di?erences in the national saving rates between the UK, US and Italy. Our work suggests that the US saving rate is lower principally because Americans on average retire later. In contrast, the Italian saving rate is higher predominantly because Italians are credit constrained, particularly when young. We also found that demography and the di?erent tax and bene?t systems are able to explain little of the cross-sectional di?erences in saving rates. The study accounts for the possible importance of intergenerational private transfers in determining saving rates.

Title: Federal Tax Competition and the Efficiency Consequences for Local Taxation of Revenue Equalization
Abstract: Recent work has shown that a system of equalization grants can limit tax competition among lower-level governments. The structure of such models, however, does not allow for the federal to be an active player but its role is being limited in the administration of the equalization grants. The implication of this is that potentially important, for the efficiency properties of lower-level government taxation, vertical fiscal externalities are ignored. This paper introduces equalization grants into a standard federal capital tax competition model in which fiscal externalities arise not only horizontally, between jurisdictions, but also vertically between the levels of government. It is shown that, even in the presence of vertical fiscal inefficiencies, efficiency in the level of lower-level government taxation can be achieved by a modifying version of a standard equalization grant formula.

Title: Corruption Around the World: Evidence from a Structural Model
Abstract: The causes and consequences of corruption have attracted much attention in recent years by both academics and policy makers. Central in the discussion on the impact of corruption are perception-based indices. Recent research has shown that perceived corruption might not be a good indicator of actual corruption in a country. In this paper, we employ a structural equation modelthat treats corruption as a latent variable that is directly related to its underlying causes and effectsto derive an index of corruption. The index of corruption is derived for approximately 100 countries over the period 1976-97.

Title: Ad Valorem Taxes and the Fiscal Gap in Federations
Abstract: This paper investigates the implications of vertical fiscal externalities for the optimal federal tax and the sign of fiscal gap in the presence of ad valorem taxation. It is shown that the federal government can always achieve the second-best optimum for public good provision. The sign of the fiscal gap is, in general, ambiguous. The consequence of this is that a precise evaluation of the fiscal gap requires an explicit consideration of the underlying fundamentals of the federal economy.

Title: Tests for Cointegration with Structural Breaks Based on Subsamples
Abstract: This paper considers tests for cointegration with allowance for structural breaks, using the extrema of residual-based tests over subsamples of the data. One motivation for the approach is to formalize the practice of data snooping by practitioners, who may examine subsamples after failing to find a predicted cointegrating relationship. Valid critical values for such multiple testing situations may be useful. The methods also have the advantage of not imposing a form for the alternative hypothesis, in particular slope vs. intercept shifts and single versus multiple breaks, and being comparatively easy to compute. A range of alternative subsampling procedures, including sample splits, incremental and rolling samples are tabulated and compared experimentally. Shiller's annual stock prices and dividends series provide an illustration.

Title: Optimal Fiscal Feedback on Debt in an Economy with Nominal Rigidities
Abstract: We examine the impact of different degrees of fiscal feedback on debt in an economy with nominal rigidities where monetary policy is optimal. We look at the extent to which different degrees of fiscal feedback enhances or detracts from the ability of the monetary authorities to stabilise output and inflation. Using an objective function derived from utility, we find the optimal level of fiscal feedback to be small. There is a clear discontinuity in the behaviour of monetary policy and welfare either side of this optimal level. As the extent of fiscal feedback increases, optimal monetary policy becomes less active because fiscal feedback tends to deflate inflationary shocks. However this fiscal stabilisation is less efficient than monetary policy, and so welfare declines. In contrast, if fiscal feedback falls below some critical value, either the model becomes indeterminate, or optimal monetary policy becomes strongly passive, and this passive monetary policy leads to a sharp deterioration in welfare.

Title: Strategic Monetary and Fiscal Policy Interactions: An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: This paper identifies leadership regimes in monetary-fiscal policy interactions in three countries, the UK, the US and Sweden. We specify a small-scale, structural general equilibrium model of an open economy and estimate it using Bayesian methods. We assume that the authorities can act strategically in a non-cooperative policy game, and compare different leadership regimes. We find that the model of fiscal leadership gives the best fit for the UK and Sweden, while in the US the Nash or non-strategic regime dominates.

Title: Inflation-Conservatism and Monetary-Fiscal Policy Interactions
Abstract: This paper investigates the stabilization bias that arises in a model of monetary and fiscal policy stabilization of the economy, when assuming that the monetary authority put higher weight on inflation stabilization than society. We demonstrate that inflation-conservatism unambiguously leads to social welfare losses if the fiscal authority acts strategically. Although the precise form of monetary-fiscal interactions depends on the choice of fiscal instrument and on the level of steady state debt, the assessment of gains is robust to these assumptions. We also study how the outcome of stabilization depends on the leadership structure. We develop an algorithm that computes leadership equilibria as well in much wider spectrum of problems with strategic agents

Title: Inflation Bias with Dynamic Phillips Curves and Impatient Policy Makers
Abstract: We generalise the analysis of inflation bias with dynamic Phillips curves in three respects. First, we examine the discretionary (time consistent) solution in cases where the Phillips curve has both a backward looking and forward-looking component. Second, we show that the commitment (time inconsistent) solution does not normally involve zero inflation and output at its natural rate. Instead, with a purely forward-looking Phillips curve and positive discounting, it will involve a dynamic path for inflation in which steady state inflation is below its target. In this sense, we obtain negative inflation bias. Third, we show that the timeless perspective policy has the same steady state as the commitment case, but without any short-term output gains.

Title: Monotone concave operators: An application to the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman equation
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the issue of existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman equation, exploiting an emerging class of methods, called monotone map methods, pioneered in the work of Krasnoselskii (1964) and Krasnoselskii-Zabreiko (1984). The approach is technically simple and intuitive. It is derived from geometric ideas related to the study of fixed points for monotone concave operators defined on partially order spaces.

Title: An Experiment on Forward versus Backward Induction: How Fairness and Levels of Reasoning Matter
Abstract: We report the experimental results on a game with an outside option where induction contradicts with background induction based on a focal, risk dominant equilibrium. The latter procedure yields the equilibrium selected by Harsanyi and Selton's (1888) theory, which is hence here in contradiction with strategic stability (Kohlberg-Mertens (1985)). We find the Harsanyi-Selton solution to be in much better agreement with our data.
Since fairness and bounded rationality seem to matter we discuss whether recent behavioral theories, in particular fairness theories and learning, might explain our findings. The fairness theories by Fehr and Schmidt (1999), Bolton and Ockenfels (2000), when calibrated using experimental data on dictator- and ultimatum games, indeed predict that forward induction should play no role for our experiment and that the outside option should be chosen by all sufficiently selfish players. However, there is a multiplicity of "fairness equilibra", some of which seem to be rejected because they require too many levels of reasoning"

Title: Refined best-response correspondence and dynamics
Abstract: We characterize the smallest faces of the polyhedron of strategy profiles that could possibly be made asymptotically stable under some reasonable deterministic dynamics. These faces are Kalai and Samet's (1984) persistent retracts and are spanned by Basu and Weibull's (1991) CURB sets based on a natural (and, in a well-defined sense, minimal) refinement of the best-reply correspondence. We show that such a correspondence satisfying basic properties such as existence, upper hemi-continuity, and convex-valuedness exists and is unique in most games. We introduce a notion of rationalizability based on this correspondence and its relation to other such concepts. We study its fixed-points and their relations to equilibrium refinements. We find, for instance, that a fixed point of the refined best reply correspondence in the agent normal form of any extensive form game constitutes a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, which is weak perfect Bayesian in every subgame. Finally, we study the index of its fixed point components.

Title: Representation and Weak Convergence of Stochastic Integrals with Fractional Integrator Processes
Abstract: This paper considers the asymptotic distribution of the covariance of a nonstationary fractionally integrated process with the stationary increments of another such process - possibly, itself. Questions of interest include the relationship between the harmonic representation of these random variables, which we have analysed in a previous paper, and the construction derived from moving average representations in the time domain. The limiting integrals are shown to be expressible in terms of functionals of It integrals with respect to two distinct Brownian motions. Their mean is nonetheless shown to match that of the harmonic representation, and they satisfy the required integration by parts rule. The advantages of our approach over the harmonic analysis include the facts that our formulae are valid for the full range of the long memory parameters, and extend to non-Gaussian processes.

Title: Public Goods and Tax Competition in a Two-Sided Market
Abstract: A rather neglected issue in the tax competition literature is the dependence of equilibrium outcomes on the presence of firms and shoppers (two-sided markets). Making use of a model of vertical and horizontal differentiation, within which jurisdictions compete by providing public goods and levying taxes in order to attract firms and shoppers, this paper characterizes the non-cooperative equilibrium. It also evaluates the welfare implications for the jurisdictions of a popular policy of tax coordination: The imposition of a minimum tax. It is shown that the interaction of the two markets affects the intensity of tax competition and the degree of optimal vertical differentiation chosen by the competing jurisdictions. Though the non-cooperative equilibrium is, as it is typically the case, inefficient such inefficiency is mitigated by the strength of the interaction in the two markets. A minimum tax policy is shown to be effective when the strength of the interaction is weak and ineffective when it is strong.

Title: Evidence on the Insurance Effect of Redistributive Taxation
Abstract: If households face uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings risk, theory predicts that redistributive tax and transfer systems have both an insurance and a distortionary effect. Exploiting the substantial variation of tax and transfer systems across US states we investigate the necessary traces of these two effects in the data: that state-level measures of redistributive taxation should correlate negatively with, (a) the standard deviation, and (b) the mean, of the within-state consumption distribution. We find that the first correlation is robust, supporting strongly the presence of an insurance effect. The distortionary effect can also be detected in the data but it is less precisely estimated.

Title: When is a Time Series I(0)?
Abstract: This paper surveys the extensive recent literature on the problems of deciding what is meant by an I(0) process, and then deciding how to test for the property. A formidable difficulty exists in the construction of consistent and asymptotically correctly sized tests for the I(0) hypothesis, and this may appear to place a question mark over the validity of a large area of econometric theory and practice. To overcome these difficulties in practical applications, the paper proposes that a slightly different question needs to be posed, relating to the adequacy of approximation to asymptotic inference criteria in finite samples. A simulation-based test, aimed at discriminating between data sets on this basis, is examined in a Monte Carlo experiment.

Title: Announcement or Contribution? The Relative Efficiency of Manipulated Lindahl Mechanisms
Abstract: The private provision mechanism is individually incentive compatible but inefficient. The Lindahl mechanism is efficient but not incentive compatible. We analyze the outcome of the manipulated Lindahl mechanism. When the demand announcements of participants are unrestricted the Lindahl mechanism suffers from multiple equilibria. If the government removes the multiplicity by restricting the functional form of announcements the resulting Lindahl equilibrium can be made approximately efficient. Approximate efficiency is achieved by announcements that are one-dimensional regardless of the number of participants in the mechanism. This is in contrast to mechanisms that achieve exact efficiency but require announcements whose dimensionality increases at the same rate as the number of participants. The mechanism we describe benefits from simplicity at the cost of approximate efficiency. We demonstrate that mechanisms in which a linear demand function is announced are supermodular so play will converge to the Nash equilibrium for a range of learning dynamics.

Title: Discretionary Policy and Multiple Equilibria in LQ RE Models
Abstract: We study discretionary equilibria in dynamic linear-quadratic rational expectations models. In contrast to the assumptions that pervade this literature we show that these models do have multiple equilibria in some situations. We investigate general properties of discretionary equilibria. We demonstrate that for multiple equilibria to exist, models must have some `history dependence' that implies sluggish adjustment. This creates possibility to have different but mutually consistent beliefs of economic agents about the future speed of stabilization. Multiple equilibria are likely to occur, in particular if there are complementarities in the model. We demonstrate the existence of multiple discretionary equilibria by example. In a simple New Keynesian model of optimal monetary policy, but with fiscal solvency constraint, monetary policy can be either `active' or `passive' in the sense of Leeper (1991), depending on the strength of fiscal control of debt. There is an intermediate strength of fiscal control when both active and passive policies are possible.

Title: The Consequences of Zakat for Capital Accumulation
Abstract: The payment of zakat by the owners of wealth is one of the five pillars of Islam. Many countries operate with no enforcement of the obligation to pay, making zakat a form of voluntary redistribution. We analyze how zakat affects capital accumulation in a model that explicitly recognizes the voluntary nature of zakat. The voluntary payment is modelled using both warm-glow and social custom frameworks. These are embedded within an overlapping generations model with heterogenous consumers and endogenous population growth. The results show that zakat can raise the capital-labor ratio when it is motivated by the warm-glow but welfare can be non-monotonic in the strength of the warm-glow. In social custom model reduced participation can lead to a reduced capital labor ratio as the rate of zakat is increased.

Title: A New Keynesian Model with Overtime Labor
Abstract: This paper extends the standard New Keynesian model by incorporating labor adjustment costs and overtime work. I show that labor frictions help reconcile the frequent price changes found in the microdata with the degree of sluggishness in inflation adjustment to output changes at the macro level. The introduction of labor frictions affects the dynamic behavior of economic variables (particularly employment and inflation) and implies that firms marginal costs should be measured in overtime costs. Marginal costs measured in overtime hours are procyclical and are predicted by inflation as suggested by theory.

Title: Type I and Type II Fractional Brownian Motions: a Reconsideration
Abstract: The so-called type I and type II fractional Brownian motions are limit distributions associated with the fractional integration model in which pre-sample shocks are either included in the lag structure, or suppressed. There can be substantial differences between the distributions of these two processes and of functionals derived from them, so that it becomes an important issue to decide which model to use as a basis for inference. Alternative methods for simulating the type I case are contrasted, and for models close to the nonstationarity boundary, truncating infinite sums is shown to result in a significant distortion of the distribution. A simple simulation method that overcomes this problem is described and implemented. The approach also has implications for the estimation of type I ARFIMA models, and a new conditional ML estimator is proposed, using the annual Nile minima series for illustration.

Title: Neutral Optima in Informed Principal Problems with Common Values
Abstract: In a class of informed principal problems with common values often used in applications we define a particular mechanism which we call the assured allocation. It is always undominated, i.e. efficient among the different types of the principal. We show it is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium allocation of the three-stage game studied in Maskin and Tirole (1992) that coincides with the Rothschild-Stiglitz- Wilson allocation when the latter is undominated. Under familiar conditions on hazard rates we show that the assured allocation is a neutral optimum in the sense of Myerson (1983).

Title: The a-MEU Model: A Comment
Abstract: In [7] Ghirardato, Macheroni and Marinacci (GMM) propose a method for distinguishing between perceived ambiguity and the decision-maker's reaction to it. They study a general class of preferences which they refer to as invariant biseparable. This class includes CEU and MEU. They axiomatize a subclass of 
a-MEU preferences. If attention is restricted to finite state spaces, we show that any 
a-MEU preference relation, satisfies GMM's axioms if and only if 
 a = 0 or 1, that is, the preferences must be either maxmin or maxmax. We show by example that these axioms may be satisfied when the state space is [0,1].

Abstract: We study a credible Markov-perfect monetary policy in an open New Keynesian economy with incomplete financial markets. We demonstrate the existence of two discretionary equilibria. Following a shock the economy can be stabilised either 'quickly' or 'slow', both dynamic paths satisfy conditions of optimality and time-consistency. The model can help us to understand sudden change of the interest rate and exchange rate volatility in 'tranquil' and 'volatile' regimes even under a fully credible 'soft peg' of the nominal exchange rate in developing countries.

Title: Optimism and Pessimism in Games
Abstract:This paper considers the impact of ambiguity in strategic situations. It extends the earlier literature by allowing for optimistic responses to ambiguity. Ambiguity is modelled by CEU preferences. We propose a new solution concept for players who may express ambiguity- preference. Then we study comparative statics of changes in ambiguity-attitude in games with strategic complements. This gives a precise statement of the impact of ambiguity on economic behaviour.

Title: Where strategic and evolutionary stability depart - a study of minimal diversity games
Abstract: A minimal diversity game is an n player strategic form game in which each player has m pure strategies at his disposal. The payoff to each player is always 1, unless all players select the same pure strategy, in which case all players receive zero payoff. Such a game has a unique isolated completely mixed Nash equilibrium in which each player plays each strategy with equal probability, and a connected component of Nash equilibria consisting of those strategy profiles in which each player receives payoff 1. The Pareto superior component is shown to be asymptotically stable under a wide class of evolutionary dynamics, while the isolated equilibrium is not. On the other hand, the isolated equilibrium is strategically stable, while the strategic stability of the Pareto efficient component depends on the dimension of the component, and hence on the number of players, and the number of pure strategies.

Title: Political Economy of Mass Media: Public Good, News and Voting Behaviour
Abstract: In every democracy mass media play a crucial role in assuring the effective working of the political system. In this paper I focus on the role of media as 'watchdog'. In an agency relationship between politician and citizens, media perform the function of an informed supervisor. Previous works have assumed that all the information available to citizens about the incumbent politician is channelled through mass media only. This work investigates how citizen's voting decision and collusion between media and politicians change if two pieces of information about the politician are available: media information and a good publicly supplied. My findings are: i) by employing both the two signals, citizens manage to sort out honest politicians from dishonest ones more often than if they were relying on media information only; ii) collusion is harder to take place than in the case of one signal only; iii) the presence of media is not always welfare improving, contrary to previous literature findings. Finally, I argue that when rules at the constitutional level are not possible and citizens cannot commit to have less information, then collusion between media and politician can be welfare improving for citizens.

Title: International Environmental Agreements under Uncertainty: Does the Veil of Uncertainty Help?
Abstract: Na and Shin (1998) showed that the veil of uncertainty can be conducive to the success of self-enforcing international environmental agreements. Later papers confirmed this negative conclusion about the role of learning. In the light of intensified research efforts worldwide to reduce uncertainty about the environmental impact of emissions and the cost of reducing them, this conclusion is intriguing. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we analyze whether the result carries over to a more general setting without restriction on the number of players and which considers not only no and full learning but also partial learning. Second, we test whether the conclusion also holds if there is uncertainty about abatement costs instead of uncertainty about the benefits from global abatement. Third, we propose a transfer scheme that mitigates the possible negative effect of learning and which may even transform it into a positive effect.

Title: Optimal Allocation without Transfer Payments
Abstract: Often an organization or government must allocate goods without collecting payment in return. This may pose a difficult problem either when agents receiving those goods have private information in regards to their values or needs or when discriminating among agents using known differences is not a viable option. In this paper, we nd an optimal mechnnism to allocate goods when the designer is benevolent. While the designer cannot charge agents, he can receive a costly but wasteful signal from them. We nd conditions for which ignoring these costly signals by giving agents equal share (or using lotteries if the goods are indivisible) is optimal. In other cases, those that send the highest signal should receive the goods; however, we then show that there exist cases where more complicated mechanisms are superior. Finally, we show that the optimal mechanism is independent of the scarcity of the goods being allocated.

Title: The Benefits of Costly Voting
Abstract: We present a costly voting model in which each voter has a private valuation for their preferred outcome of a vote. When there is a zero cost to voting, all voters vote and hence all values are counted equally regardless of how high they may be. By having a cost to voting, only those with high enough values would choose to incur this cost. Hence, the outcome will be determined by voters with higher valuations. We show that in such a case welfare may be enhanced. Such an effect occurs when there is both a large enough density of voters with low values and a high enough expected value.

Title: Vote or Shout
Abstract: We examine an environment with n voters each with a private value over two alternatives. We compare the social surplus of two mechanisms for deciding between them: majority voting and shouting. In majority voting, the choice with the most votes wins. With shouting, the voter who shouts the loudest (sends the costliest wasteful signal) chooses the outcome. We find that it is optimal to use voting in the case where n is large and value for each particular alternative of the voters is bounded. For other cases, the superior mechanism depends upon the order statistics of the distribution of values.

Title: An Experimental Investigation of Entry Cost Effects in Sealed Bid Dollar Auctions
Abstract: In numerous auction settings potential bidders incur costs to enter the auction. Such costs may potentially influence bidders behavior subsequently. In this paper we experimentally study the effect of entry costs on bidding and entry behavior, through a complete information common value auction. We run first and second price auctions both with and without entry costs. We find that with entry costs, players on average bid lower in first price auctions, while in second price auctions the average bids are higher, compared to bids in the corresponding no entry fee auctions.

Title: The Treasury and the New Cambridge School in the 1970s
Abstract: With the release of Treasury papers from the 1970s under the 30-year rule we have a much more complete picture of the dispute in the 1970s between the Treasury and the Cambridge Economic Policy Group, especially given the role of three Cambridge economists -- Nicholas Kaldor, Wynne Godley and Francis Cripps  as ministerial advisers at the time. The records show the Treasury and the CEPG eventually meeting near the middle regarding the latters proposition of stable private-sector NAFA (Net Acquisition of Private Sector Assets) and its implications for demand management and the balance of payments. By contrast, the initial differences on counter-inflation policy and, above all, on import controls versus free trade were wider at the end of the decade than at the start of it.

Title: Economic Voting in Britain, 1857-1914
Abstract: Despite limited government control over the pre-1914 economy, opposition politicians were enthusiastic in blaming bad economic news on the incumbent. In a study of 458 by-elections between 1857 and 1914, we find that voters typically gave new governments a 'honeymoon' but thereafter held them responsible for high unemployment and high prices. Each 1% rise in the price level, on average, brought about a 0.21% swing against the government of the day, while each one-point rise in the percentage unemployed had double this effect. Attributing shorter- or longer-term memories to voters, as they used the past to determine what constituted unacceptable price and unemployment levels, makes little difference to this result. We also look at grievance asymmetry - the idea that voters give governments more blame for bad outcomes than they give credit for good ones - and find some evidence in its favour.

Title: Constraints on profit income distribution and production efficiency in private ownership economies with Ramsey taxation
Abstract: In economies with Ramsey taxation, decreasing returns to scale, and private ownership, we show that second-best production efficiency is desirable when profit tax rates vary across groups of firms provided that the institutional rules which define profit incomes of consumers depend on the distribution of profits across these groups of firms. The classic results of Dasgupta and Stiglitz [1972] (of firm-specific profit taxation) and Diamond and Mirrlees [1971] and Guesnerie [1995] (of uniform one-hundred percent profit taxation) follow as special cases of our model. Moreover, second-best analysis suggests the desirability of proportionate taxation of inter-firm transactions in the absence of profit taxes. Alternatively, it recommends profit taxation as a perfect substitute for intermediate-input taxation. The analysis also suggests that, combined with the knowledge of the distribution of profit incomes in the economy, profit taxation can promote both efficiency and redistributive objectives of the government.

Title: Unit Versus Ad Valorem Taxes: The Private Ownership of Monopoly In General Equilibrium
Abstract: Employing a general equilibrium framework, Blackorby and Murty [2007] prove that, with a monopoly and under one hundred percent profit taxation and uniform lump-sum transfers, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and ad valorem taxes are identical. This welfare-equivalence is in contrast to most previous studies, which demonstrate the superiority of the ad valorem tax in a partial equilibrium framework. In this paper we relax the assumption of one hundred percent profit taxation and allow the consumers to receive profit incomes from ownership of shares in the monopoly firm. We find that, under certain regularity conditions, for any fixed vector of profit shares, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and ad valorem taxes are not generally identical. But it does not imply that one completely dominates the other. Rather, the two utility possibility frontiers cross each other. Additionally, employing a standard partial equilibrium welfare analysis, we show that the Marshallian social surpluses resulting from the two tax structures are identical when the government can implement unrestricted transfers.

Title: On modeling pollution-generating technologies
Abstract: Distinguishing between intended ("good") production and unintended or residual ("bad") generation, we introduce the concept of by-production. In by-production technologies, pollution is an output that satisfies a "costly disposability" assumption and violates standard free disposability with respect to pollution-causing inputs. Our approach therefore differs substantially from standard approaches to modeling pollution-generating technologies. We show how by-production can be modeled using data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods. With an electric power plant database, we illustrate shortcomings under by-production of two popular efficiency indexes: the hyperbolic index and the directional distance function. We propose and implement an alternative efficiency index with superior properties.

Title: Expectations Traps and Monetary Policy with Limited Commitment
Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness properties of monetary policy with limited commitment in LQ RE models. We use a New Keynesian model with debt accumulation in the spirit of Leeper (1991) as a `lab', because this model generates multiple equilibria under pure discretion, and under full commitment there are two distinct determinate regimes. We study how these properties change over the continuum of intermediate cases between commitment and discretion. We find that although multiple equilibria exist for high degrees of precommitment, even a small degree of precommitment selects a unique equilibrium for a wide range of parameters.  We discuss the stability properties of policy equilibria which can be used to design an equilibrium selection criterion. We also demonstrate very different welfare implications for different policy equilibria.

Title: The Incentive Structure of Impure Public Good Provision  The Case of International Fisheries
Abstract: We argue that international fisheries are a prime example to study the impact of multiple characteristics on the incentive structure of impure public good provision. The degree of technical excludability is related to the pattern of fish migration, the degree of socially constructed excludability is captured by the design of international law and the degree of rivalry is reflected by the growth rate of the resource. We construct a bioeconomic model, including the high seas and exclusive economic zones in order to study the incentives to form stable fully or partially cooperative agreements. We show that the spatial allocation of property rights is crucial for the success of cooperation as long as technical excludability is sufficiently high. Moreover, we show how economic and ecological factors influence the success of cooperation.

Title: To assemble to resemble? A study of tax disparities among French municipalities 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of inter-municipal cooperation on local taxation. Municipalities that join/create an inter-municipal jurisdiction choose between three tax regimes, which may induce both horizontal and vertical tax externalities. Using the differences in differences method with a quasi-exhaustive panel for French municipalities over the 1994-2010 period, we show a positive causal effect of cooperation on the level of cumulative tax rates (i.e. the sum of municipal and inter-municipal tax rates). In addition, we show that cooperation leads to a convergence of tax rates within an inter-municipal structure, which thus reduces tax disparities among municipalities.

Title: Why has Britain fewer marginal seats than it used to?
Abstract: The decline in the number of marginal constituencies in Britain is often attributed to the increasing geographical polarisation of the electorate, with the North having become even more pro-Labour and the South even more pro-Conservative. We show that this has been more than neutralised by the weakening links between social class and voting behaviour, and explain the fall in the number of marginals by the party, not just personal, incumbency effects which tend to pile up in all but the most marginal seats.

Title: Coordinating Climate and Trade Policies: Pareto Efficiency and the Role of Border Tax Adjustments
Abstract: This paper explores the role of trade instruments in globally efficient climate policies, focusing on the central issue of whether border tax adjustment (BTA) is warranted when carbon prices differ internationally. It shows that tariff policy has a role in easing cross-country distributional concerns that can make non-uniform carbon pricing efficient, and that Pareto-efficiency requires a form of BTA when carbon taxes in some countries are constrained, a special case being identified in which this has the simple structure envisaged in practical policy discussion. It also stressesa point that has been overlooked in the policy debatethat the case for BTA depends critically on whether climate policies are pursued by carbon taxation or by cap-and-trade.

Title: Inequality in Developing Economies: The Role of Institutional Development
Abstract: This paper studies the distributive impact of institutional change in developing countries. In such economies, property rights systems may preserve the interests of an influential minority, who can control key-markets, access to assets and investment opportunities, especially if they enjoy disproportionate political power. We test this hypothesis using cross-section and panel data methods on a sample of low- and middle-income economies from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Results suggest that: (a) increasing property rights protection increases income inequality; (b) this effect is larger in low-democracy environments; (c) few countries have developed political institutions capable of counterbalancing this effect.

Title: Degree of Policy Precommitment in the UK: An Empirical Investigation of Monetary and Fiscal Policy Interactions
Abstract: This paper investigates the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy in the UK in the period of the Bank of England independence and before the start of the quantitative easing. Using a simple DSGE New Keynesian model of non-cooperative monetary and fiscal policy interactions under the fiscal intra-period leadership we demonstrate that the past policy in the UK is better explained as following optimal policy under discretion than under commitment. We estimate policy objectives of both policy makers, and derive implied policy rules.

Title: International Taxation and FDI Strategies: Evidence From US Cross-Border Acquisitions
Abstract: While there is a well-established body of empirical research documenting the negative effect of taxation on foreign direct investment (FDI), there is scant evidence on the extent to which international tax considerations (double taxation, international tax relief stipulated in bilateral tax treaties and the effect of withholding taxes) affect the role of taxation for FDI, and how tax issues differ according to the investment strategieshorizontal and verticalpursued by %multinational firms. This paper addresses these issues. Using data on US acquisitions over the period 1995-2005 in 18 OECD countries, it is shown that international tax relief plays a critical role in determining the impact of taxation. Regardless of the type of investment strategy, the significantly negative effect of corporate taxes disappears when accounting for the tax credits stipulated in bilateral tax treaties. It is also shown that there is considerable heterogeneity of the impact of sales taxes across investment strategies. High administrative burden to comply with taxation always reduces a countrys appeal as target for FDI.

Title: The Theory of By-Production of Emissions and Capital-Constrained Non-Cooperative Nash Outcomes of a Global Economy
Abstract: The reduced form approaches that are commonly adopted in the literature to model emission-generating technologies (EGTs) do not distinguish between emission-causing and non-emission causing goods in production. We provide a new set of axioms to describe EGTs. Technologies that satisfy these axioms are called by-production technologies (BPTs). A distance function representation of BPTs is derived and it is shown that a BPT can be decomposed into a standard neo-classical intended-production technology and nature's emission-generation set (the relationship in nature between emissions and emission-causing goods). As an illustrative application of the BP approach, we study cross-country differences in emission levels due to cross-country di
erences in capital endowments at a noncooperative Nash equilibrium, where emissions impose both local and global externalities. The change in emission levels as we move from capital-poor to capital-rich countries is decomposed into income and substitution e
ects. The latter are a result of changes in the trade-off between intended-production and emission-generation, which is attributed to diminishing returns to emission-causing inputs or cleaning-up activities, while the nature of the former is governed by the assumption that emission is an inferior good. The implications of increasing returns to capital, substitutability or complementarity between capital and emission-causing inputs such as fuels, extraction costs of fuels, and inter-fuel substitution in production are studied and a set of conditions that result in an environmental Kuznets curve is derived.

Title: A Cautionary Note on Tests for Overidentifying Restrictions 
Abstract: Tests of overidentifying restrictions are widely used in practice. However, there is often confusion about the nature of their null hypothesis and about the interpretation of their outcome. In this note we argue that these tests give little information on whether the instruments are correlated with the errors of the underlaying economic model and on whether they identify parameters of interest.

Title: Universal banking, competition and risk in a macro model 
Abstract: A stylized macroeconomic model is developed with an indebted, heterogeneous Investment Banking Sector funded by borrowing from a retail banking  sector. The government guarantees retail deposits. Investment banks choose how risky their activities should be. We find that the financial sector can move very sharply from safe to risky investment strategies and that the degree of competitiveness is important for risk premia. We also compared the benefits of separated vs. universal banking modelled as a vertical integration of the retail and investment banks. The incidence of banking default is considered under different constellations of shocks and degrees of competitiveness. The benefits of universal banking rise in the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks to trading strategies and are positive even for very bad common shocks, even though government bailouts, which are costly, are larger compared to the case of separated banking entities. The benefits of universal banking are positive but decreasing in the value and volatility of shocks to the quality of financial capital. When shock is moderate, competition improves the welfare. However, banks with some market power have a cushion of profits against adverse shocks which is beneficial since there is an excess burden associated with government bailouts. Hence, when a worse shock hits the economy, the optimal degree of competitiveness of separate banking firms is higher than for universal firms. So, the welfare assessment of the structure of banks may depend crucially on the kinds of shock hitting the economy as well as on the efficiency of government intervention.

Title: On the properties of an emission-generating technology and its parametric representation 
Abstract: We propose a set of comprehensive axioms that seek to capture our intuitive understanding of the properties of an emission-generating technology (EGT). We show that an EGT that satises these axioms can be parametrically represented by more than one implicit production function that are derived from it. Here, these production functions take the form of distance functions rst introduced by Shephard [1953] and Malmquist [1953]. One of these production relations has properties of a neo-classical production function that shows how standard inputs are transformed into standard (intended) outputs. The remaining reect trade-offs, observed in nature, between emissions, emission-causing goods, and cleaning-up activities of the producing unit. We illustrate this by considering two cases: (i) where each type of cleaning-up activity jointly mitigates all types of emissions and (ii) where cleaning-up activities are emission-specic allowing also for the possibility that a cleaning-up activity while helping to reduce certain emissions, can also contribute to more of some other types of emissions.

Title: Microfoundations for the Environmental Kuznets Curve: Invoking By-Production, Normality and Inferiority of Emissions 
Abstract: A by-production-cum-preference based approach is adopted to study the relation between national income and environmental quality under non-cooperative behaviour.  While emission is  an inferior good for richly endowed economies, it is a normal good for the developing  economies. With increases in endowments, the marginal willingness to pay declines (respectively, increases) in the set of poorly (respectively, richly) endowed economies. Hence, for emissions, the income and substitution effects  work in opposite directions. Abatement strategies include cleaning-up; decreases in and  substitution between  fuels of varying costs, emission, and energy intensities; and the diversion of capital from fuel-intensive to non-fuel intensive uses. Poorly (respectively, richly) endowed economies are characterized by weak (respectively, strong) environmental policies. Consequently, deteriorating abatement practices are adopted by the developing economies. The shape of the income-environmental quality graph depends on the relative strengths of income and substitution effects and the set of available abatement strategies. Both  inverted U and   N-shaped environmental Kuznets curves are possible. The latter arises due to stronger substitution effects and lower opportunity costs of fuel-intensive capital in the more richer of the richest economies.

Title: Evaluating the Role of Firm-Specific Capital in New Keynesian models
Abstract: In this paper I make use of Bayesian methods to estimate a firm-specific capital DSGE model with Calvo price and wage setting. This approach allows me to firmly conclude that firm-specific capital is highly relevant in improving the fit of New Keynesian models to the data as shown by a large increase in the value of the log marginal data density relative to the more conventional rental capital model. The introduction of firm-specific capital also has important implications for business cycle dynamics leading to increased persistence of aggregate variables and helps reduce the discrepancy between macro estimates of the NKPC and the observed frequent price adjustments in the micro data.

Title: Universality of Nash Components
Abstract: We show that Nash equilibrium components are universal for the collection of connected polyhedral sets. More precisely for every polyhedral set we construct a so-called binary game  a common interest game whose common payoff to the players is at most equal to onewhose success set (the set of strategy profiles where the maximal payoff of one is indeed achieved) is homeomorphic to the given polyhedral set. Since compact semi-algebraic sets can be triangulated, a similar result follows for the collection of connected compact semi-algebraic sets.

Title: An Experiment on the Causes of Bank Run Contagions
Abstract: To understand the mechanisms behind bank run contagions, we conduct bank run experiments in a modified Diamond-Dybvig setup with two banks (Left and Right). The banks' liquidity levels are either linked or independent. Left Bank depositors see their bank's liquidity level before deciding. Right Bank depositors only see Left Bank withdrawals before deciding. We find that Left Bank depositors' actions signicantly affect Right Bank depositors' behavior, even when liquidities are independent. Furthermore, a panic may be a one-way street: an increase in Left Bank withdrawals can cause a panic run on the Right Bank, but a decrease cannot calm markets.

Title: The Effect of Social Fragmentation on Public Good Provision: an Experimental Study
Abstract: We study the role of social identity in determining the impact of social frag-
mentation on public good provision using laboratory experiments. We find that
as long as there is some degree of social fragmentation, increasing it leads to lower public good provision. This is mainly because the share of those who contribute fully to the public good diminishes with social fragmentation, while the share of free-riders is unchanged, which suggests social identity preferences drive our result, as opposed to self-interest. Importantly, socially homogeneous groups do not generate the highest contributions: some social diversity is actually welfare-improving. Finally, social fragmentation is felt differently for visible minorities, whose contributions are higher than minority groups whose actions are not identiable.

Title: Monetary regimes and statistical regularity: the Classical Gold Standard (1880-1913) through the lenses of Markov models
Abstract: We aim at characterizing the Classical Gold Standard period (CGS) in order to verify if it is endowed with statistical regularity. We study the statistical properties of two-state annual transition matrices of countries switching from a sound state to a crisis state focusing on Reinhart and Rogoff 2009 dataset on external debt crises. The CGS period is governed by homogeneity both in time and across statistical units: the Homogeneous Markov Chain Model holds whereas the Mover Stayer Model does not. Our work is linked to the literature on the CGS and credibility (Bordo and Rockoff 1996). We follow a pure statistical approach to highlight two decisive channels of the credibility mechanism. The first is the stabilization of the probability of default of sound countries. The second is the fact that the CGS makes periphery/deficit countries homogeneous to the core with respect to the probability of default. Both channels are decisive because poor developing countries can borrow at favorable conditions and finance a level of investment greater than their capacity of saving.

Title: Discrimination via Exclusion: An Experiment on Group Identity and Club Goods
Abstract: We study using laboratory experiments the impact on cooperation of allowing individuals to invest in group-specific, excludable public goods. We find that allowing different social groups to voluntarily contribute to such goods increases total contributions. However, a significant proportion of that contribution goes towards the group-specific club good, rather than the public good, even when the latter has higher financial returns to cooperation. We find significant evidence of in-group biases, which are manifested by positive in-group reciprocity. That is, club goods allow subjects to display their preferences for interaction with their in-group members, as well as in positive in-group reciprocity.

Title: Should Central Bank respond to the Changes in the Loan to Collateral Value Ratio and in the House Prices?
Abstract:We study optimal policy in a New Keynesian model at zero bound interest rate where households use cash alongside with house equity borrowing to conduct transactions. The amount of borrowing is limited by a collateral constraint. When either the loan to value ratio declines or house prices fall we observe decrease in the money multiplier. We argue that the central bank should respond to the fall in the money multiplier and therefore to the reduction in house prices or in the loan to collateral value ratio. We also find that optimal monetary policy generates large and more persistent fall in the money multiplier in response to drop in the loan to collateral value ratio.

Title: Assessing the empirical relevance of Walrasian labor frictions to business cycle fluctuations
Abstract: This paper describes and estimates (with a Bayesian likelihood approach) an otherwise standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, with both sticky prices and wages, augmented with several labor market rigidities (of a Walrasian nature), namely: indivisible labor, predetermined straight time employment numbers (in which case, firms adjust overtime employment to respond to unexpected shocks), hiring expenses and convex adjustment costs. The results show all these frictions to be empirically important. Labor frictions are shown to have important implications to business cycle dynamics and economic policy making. Labor frictions imply TFP shocks have a greater role in accounting for business cycle dynamics. Labor frictions also imply fiscal policy to lead to a greater crowding out of private sector activity and monetary policy to be more eective in achieving disinflation.

Abstract: We show that the quantile regression estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal when the error terms are correlated within clusters but independent across clusters. A consistent estimator of the covariance matrix of the asymptotic distribution is provided and we propose a speci?cation test capable of detecting the presence of intra-cluster correlation. A small simulation study illustrates the ?nite sample performance of the test and of the covariance matrix estimator.

Title: Fixed versus Variable Rate Debt Contracts and Optimal Monetary Policy
Abstract: What role does the proportion of fixed versus variable rate debt contracts play in the macroeconomy? We explore this issue by integrating borrowing-constrained households with a quantity-optimising banking sector that lends under either fixed or variable rates. Our framework is then used to investigate the relationships between the structure of debt contracts and monetary policy. In particular, we study the propagation of productivity shocks in the non-durable sector under Ramsey monetary policy. The introduction of overlapping debt contracts tempers the effect of the financial multiplier and reduces the deterministic component of social welfare, but we also show that an appropriate design of debt contracts, including both their length and their interest rate composition, can reduce volatility of the key economic variables, in such a way that the financial sector can play a stabilising role in the economy. We demonstrate that an intermediate ratio of fixed- and variable-rate debt contracts is socially optimal.

Title: Monetary Transmission to UK Retail Mortgage Rates before and after August 2007
Abstract: This paper investigates the transmission from UK policy and a range of wholesale money market rates to retail mortgage rates using the long-run estimator proposed by Phillips and Loretan (1991), with a single-equation error correction model (SEECM) framework, from 1995 to 2009. I document the economy-wide effect of the financial market turmoil since August 2007, and show how this has altered long- and short-term relationships. In the long-run there is evidence of a contrast between the discounted mortgage rates that banks may use to initially attract customers, and standard variable rates, with pass-through complete for the former but not for the latter. For fixed rate mortgages, pass-through is generally complete. Since the crisis, for eight of the seventeen estimated relationships I find strong evidence in the long-run of both a significant jump in equilibrium spreads, and a fall in pass-through, whilst in the short-run there is a considerable weakening of the process that re-adjusts retail rates back towards their equilibrium with the money market. Although I do not find strong statistical evidence for an asymmetric re-adjustment process before August 2007, retail mortgage rates generally take considerably longer to move back towards their equilibrium with wholesale rates during times when they are relatively expensive. These results add to previous studies by showing that the UK retail banking sector is imperfectly competitive at the aggregate level, and also suggest that discounted rates are used as a highly competitive loss-leader product.

Title: Universal vs separated banking with deposit insurance in a macro model
Abstract: A macroeconomic model is developed to analyse integration of retail and investment banks with and without deposit insurance. Benefits flow from elimination of double marginalization and insurance premia which retail banks otherwise charge investment banks. Deposit insurance increases average output, whether banks are universal or separated, and can be welfare improving as it counters monopoly distortion. However, when unfavourable shocks hit the economy, the size of government bailout is larger with integrated than with separated banks. The welfare assessment of the structure of banks depends on the kinds of shock hitting the economy, the degree of competitiveness of the banking sectors as well as on the efficiency of government intervention (the excess burden of deposit insurance). Scenarios are sketched in which different banking structures are desirable.

Title: Distributional effects of hiring through networks
Abstract: How would a policy that bans the use of networks in hiring (e.g., anti-old boy network laws) affect welfare? To answer this question, we examine a variant of Galenianos (2013), a version of a random search model with two matching technologies: a standard matching function and worker networks. Our model has two types of workers, networked workers and non-networked workers. It is shown that the effects of such a policy on non-networked workers can be either positive or negative, depending on model parameters. In our calibration such a policy would make non-networked workers slightly worse off and networked workers substantially worse off.

Title: Why Ten $1s Are Not Treated as a $10.
Abstract: We study the stability of monetary steady states in a random matching model of money where money is indivisible, the bound on individual money holding is finite, and the trading protocol is buyer take-it-or-leave-it offers. The class of steady states we study have a non-full-support money-holding distribution and are constructed from the steady states of Zhu (2003). We show that no equilibrium path converges to those steady states if the initial distribution has a different support.

Title: Trejos-Wright with a 2-unit bound: existence and stability of monetary steady states
Abstract: This paper investigates a Trejos-Wright random matching model of money with a consumer take-it-or-leave-it offer and with individual money holdings in the set {0, 1, 2}. It is shown that three kinds of monetary steady state exist generically: (1) pure-strategy full-support steady states, (2) mixed-strategy full-support steady states, and (3) non-full-support steady states. A full-support steady state exists if and only if a non-full-support steady state exists. Stability of these steady states is also studied. Both pure-strategy and mixedstrategy full-support steady states are locally stable. However, non-full-support steady states are unstable.

Title: Consistent Model Specification Testing
Abstract: This paper proposes a consistent model speci?cation test that can be applied to a wide class of models and estimators, including all variants of quasi-maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments. Our framework is independent of the form of the model and generalizes Bierens?(1982, 1990) approach. It has particular applications in new cases such as heteroskedastic errors, discrete data models, but the chief appeal of our approach is that it provides a "one size ?ts all" test. We specify a test based on a linear combination of individual components of the indicator vector that can be computed routinely, does not need to be tailored to the particular model, and is expected to have power against a wide class of alternatives. Although primarily envisaged as a test of functional form, this type of moment test can also be extended to testing for omitted variables.

Title: Decentralised Bilateral Trading in a Market with Incomplete Information
Abstract: We study a model of decentralised bilateral interactions in a small market where one of the sellers has private information about her value. There are two identical buyers and another seller, whose valuation is commonly known to be in between the two possible valuations of the informed seller. We consider two in?nite horizon games, with public and private simultaneous one-sided oers respectively and simultaneous responses. We show that there is a stationary perfect Bayes?equilibrium for both models such that prices in all transactions converge to the same value as the discount factor goes to 1.

Title: Dynamic Moral Hazard and Stopping
Abstract: We analyse a simple model of dynamic moral hazard in which there is a clear and tractable trade-off between static and dynamic incentives. In our model, a principal wants an agent to complete a project. The agent undertakes unobservable effort, which affects in each period the probability that the project is completed. We characterise the contracts that the principal sets, with and without commitment. We show that with full commitment, the contract involves the agents value and wage declining over time, in order to give the agent incentives to exert effort. The long-run levels of the value and wage depend on the relative discount rates of the principal and agent. We also characterise the set of sequentially rational equilibria, where the principal has no commitment power.

Title: Strategic Experimentation with Heterogeneous Agents and Payoff Externalities
Abstract: This paper analyses a two-player game of strategic experimentation with two-armed bandits.At least one of the arms is risky in the sense that it may not yield a lumpsum payoff. There is payoff externality between the players and they differ in their ability to learn across the risky arm. Either player has to decide in a continous time regarding which arm to use. Two alternative settings are analysed. The first setting has two risky arms which are perfectly negatively correlated. The other one has one safe arm and one risky arm. I show that in equilibrium (Markovian) there is always too much of duplication which implies that with respect to a social planner's solution, risky arms are explored excessively.

Title: Explaining Behavior in the "11-20 Game
Abstract: We investigate whether subjects behavior in the Arad and Rubinstein (2012) "11-20" game could be well explained by the k-level process described by the authors. We replicated their game in our baseline experiment and provided two other variations that retained the same mixed-strategy equilibrium but resulted in different predicted behavior by the k-level process. Our experiments results suggest that k-level process leads to inconsistent predictions. In contrast to the standard k-level process as in Arad and Rubinstein, we allow players to best respond stochastically in our "SK" model and compared the models statistical fit against the Quantal Response Equilibrium and Cognitive Hierarchy Model. The SK model and Cognitive Model were able to outperform the QRE in a statistical sense and performed as well as each other. In addition, theCognitiveHierarchy and to lesser extend the SK model, demonstrate consistent estimates. Our findings suggest that the behavioral assumptions of Arad and Rubinstein k-level process does not fully explain behavior in the "11-20" and better explanations could be obtained when one allows for stochastic best responds as in the SK and Cognitive Hierarchy Models.

Title: Horizontal, Vertical, and Conglomerate Cross Border Acquisitions
Abstract: By using data on cross-border acquisitions (CBAs), this paper explores the distribution of the strategies pursued when multinational enterprises integrate a foreign subsidiary into their organizational structure. Based on a measure of vertical relatedness, each of the 165,000 acquisitions in our sample covering 31 source and 58 host countries can be classified as horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate. Three novel features of CBAs are highlighted. First, horizontal and vertical CBAs are relatively stable over time. Second, substantial parts of CBAs involve conglomerate acquisitions. Third, the wave-like growth of CBAs arises primarily from changes in conglomerate activity, which responds to international valuation differences between financial markets.

Title: A Theory of Trade Policy Under Dictatorship and Democratization
Abstract: This paper develops a new model of trade policy under dictatorship and democratization. The paper makes two contributions. One is to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between political institutions and economic performance by studying the endogenous interaction between the form of government and trade policy. If a ruling elite own a factor that is scarce then democratization goes hand in hand with trade liberalization and an increase in economic efficiency, as argued by classical scholars. But if the elite own an abundant factor then democratization is accompanied by an increase in protectionism and a reduction in e ciency. The paper also characterizes the circumstances under which a dictatorship can use trade policy to forestall democratization. The paper?s second contribution is to show how trade policy can be manipulated to maintain the status quo in the face of world price shocks, thus opening the door to a re-examination of trade policy responses to technology shocks. The model is used to explain an interesting episode of trade policymaking between 1815 and 1846, during which time Britain substantially liberalized trade while Prussia, on the other side of the grain market, signi?cantly increased protectionism. It is also used to shed light on the wide-spread imposition of export restrictions in response to the 2007-08 food crisis.

Title: Strategic Experimentation with Competition and Private Arrival of Information 
Abstract: This paper considers a two-armed bandit problem with one safe arm and one risky arm. The risky arm if good, can potentially experience two kinds of arrivals. One is publicly observable and the other is private to the agent who experiences it. The safe arm experiences publicly observable arrivals according to a given intensity. Private arrivals yield no payoff. Only the first publicly observed arrival(in any of the arms) yields a payo of 1 unit. Players start with a common prior about the quality of the risky arm. It has been shown that in a particular kind symmetric equilibrium, conditional on no arrival players tend to experiment too much along the risky arm if they start with too high a prior and experiment too less if they start with a low prior.

Title: On the environmental Kuznets curve with fossil-fuel induced emission: Theory and some illustrative examples
Abstract: We propose a model of fossil-fuel induced emission, which permits multiple emission-mitigation strategies. In a differentiable framework, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an environmental Kuznets curve in terms of the relative responses of the preference and technology-based shadow prices of emission to changes in the economic resource base when the emission policy is not allowed to adjust. Employing these conditions we construct examples of preference and technology combinations that result in an EKC in both static and dynamic frameworks. In these examples, optimal emission-mitigation strategies include employing a part of available resources for cleaning-up activities and inter-fuel substitution from dirtier to cleaner energy inputs. We show that the social optimum can be decentralised not only through standard emission policies such a Pigouvian tax, but also by a scheme that subsidises cleaning-up activities and taxes the usage of fossil fuels.

Title: Necessary and sufficient conditions for an environmental Kuznets curve with some illustrative examples
Abstract: We propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) phenomenon in a general model that permits non-smooth preferences and feasible sets and corner solutions for welfare maximisation. These conditions pertain to the relationship between the sets of preference and technology-based shadow prices at an outcome reached by an emission-held-fixed-effect (EHFE), where the emission policy does not adjust to an increase in the economic resource base and only consumption adjusts. In particular, an EKC arises if and only if there exists a threshold level of resource such that, at any level of resource below (respectively, above) the threshold, the outcome reached by the EHFE is one where the set of preference-based shadow prices lies completely below (respectively, above) the set of technological shadow prices. This characterisation is employed to study and construct examples of preference-technology combinations that can potentially result in an EKC, when emission is a consumption externality. In particular, the cases of homothetic economies, increasing returns to abatement, emission as a normal good, and EKC in a model with economic growth are studied.

Title: Trading Participation Rights to the Red Hat Puzzle. An Experiment
Abstract: This paper investigates the conventional wisdom that markets should allocate the rights for performing decisional tasks to those players who might be best suited to perform the task. I embed the decisional tasks in a stylised setting of a game, motivated by Littlewood (1953) Red Hat Puzzle, where the optimal choices in the game require players to employ logical and epistemological reasoning. I present a treatment where players are permitted to trade their participation rights to the game. The payo?s are furthermore calibrated such that those players who know the optimal choices in the game should value the participation rights strictly more than those who do not. However, aggregated performances in this treatment were found to be significantly lower than the control treatments where players were not permitted to trade their participation rights, providing little support for the conventional wisdom. I show that this finding could be attributed to price bubbles in the markets for participations rights.

Title: Randomization and Dynamic Consistency
Abstract: Raiffa (1961) has suggested that ambiguity aversion will cause a strict preference for randomization. We show that dynamic consistency implies that individuals will be indifferent to ex ante randomizations. On the other hand, it is possible for a dynamically-consistent ambiguity averse preference relation to exhibit a strict preference for some ex post randomizations. We argue that our analysis throws some light on the recent debate about paradoxes for the smooth model of ambiguity. We show that these rest on whether the randomizations implicit in the set-up are viewed as being resolved before or after the (ambiguous) uncertainty.

Title: An Experimental Study on the Effect of Ambiguity in a Coordination Game
Abstract: We report an experimental test of the influence of ambiguity on behaviour in a coordination game. We study the behaviour of subjects in the presence of ambiguity and attempt to determine whether they prefer to choose an ambiguity safe option. We fi?nd that this strategy, which is not played in either Nash equilibrium or iterated dominance equilibrium, is indeed chosen quite frequently. This provides evidence that ambiguity aversion infl?uences behaviour in games. While the behaviour of the Row Player is consistent with randomising between her strategies, the Column Player shows a marked preference for avoiding ambiguity and choosing his ambiguity-safe strategy.

Title: Contests with Ambiguity
Abstract: The paper examines the effect of ambiguity on contests where multiple parties expend resources to win a prize. We develop a model where contenders perceive ambiguity about their opponents strategies and determine how perceptions of ambiguity and attitudes to ambiguity affect equilibrium choice. The paper also investigates how equilibrium under ambiguity is related to behavior where contenders have expected utility preferences. Our model can explain experimental results such as overbidding and overspreading relative to Nash predictions.

Title: World Price Shocks, Income, and Democratization
Abstract: This paper shows how a world price shock can increase the likelihood that democratization must be used to resolve the threat of revolution. Initially, a ruling elite may be able to use trade policy to maintain political stability. But a world price shock can push the country into a situation where the elite face a commitment problem that only democratization can resolve. Because the world price shock may also reduce average incomes, the model provides a way to understand why the level of national income per capita and democracy may not be positively correlated. The model is also useful for understanding dictatorial regimes ?rebuttal of World Bank calls to keep their export markets open in the face of the 2007-08 world food crisis.

Title: Capital Taxes, Labor Taxes and the Household
Abstract: We study the impact of capital and labor taxation in an economy where couples bargain over the intrahousehold allocation. We present a life cycle model with heterogeneous individuals and incomplete nancial markets. Drawing from the literature of the collective framework of household behavior, we model decision making within the couple as a contract under limited commitment. In this framework more wealth improves commitment and gives rise to insurance gains within the household. Our theory motivates these gains by the empirical observation that wealth, in contrast to labor income, is a commonly held resource within households. Based on this observation we study whether eliminating capital taxes from the economy, and raising labor taxes to balance the government's budget, may generate welfare gains to married households. We illustrate that the quantitative eects from this reform are rather small. We attribute the small effects to the life cycle pattern of wealth accumulation and to the impact of labor income taxes on household risk sharing: In particular, we show that higher labor taxes may deteriorate the limited commitment problem, even though they may make the distribution of labor income more equitable within the household.

Title: Religious fragmentation, social identity and cooperation: Evidence from a artefactual field experiment in India
Abstract: We study the role of village-level religious fragmentation on intra- and inter-group cooperation in India. We report on data on two-player Prisoners Dilemma and Stag Hunt experiments played by 516 Hindu and Muslim participants in rural India. Our treatments are the identity of the two players and the degree of village-level religious heterogeneity. In religiously-heterogeneous villages, cooperation rates in the Prisoners Dilemma are higher when subjects play with another in-group member for both Hindus and Muslims, but to a much lesser extent in the Stag Hunt game. This suggests that positive in-group biases operate primarily on the willingness to achieve socially efficient outcomes, rather than through beliefs about the actions by one's counterpart. Interestingly, cooperation rates among people of the same religion are significantly lower in homogeneous villages than in fragmented villages in both games. This is likely because a sense of group identity is only meaningful in the presence of an out-group. This, together with little evidence for out-group prejudice in either game, means religious diversity is beneficial.

Title: Stationarity of Econometric Learning with Bounded Memory and a Predicted State Variable
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a model where producers set their prices based on their prediction of the aggregated price level and an exogenous variable, which can be a demand or a cost-push shock. To form their expectations, they use OLS-type econometric learning with bounded memory. We show that the aggregated price follows the random coefficient autoregressive process and we prove that this process is covariance stationary.

Title: Bank Equity and Macroprudential Policy
Abstract: We investigate a new macroprudential policy in a DSGE model with fi?nancial frictions. As Gertler, Kiyotaki and Queralto (2012), we propose to subsidize bank equities. However, our tax rate is different from their policy. The tax rate in our macroprudential policy is proportional to capital ratio gap while it is proportional to the shadow price of bank deposit in Gertler et al. (2012). Our policy has two advantages: Firstly, because bank?s balance sheet structure is observable target for central bank, our policy is more applicable for practical policy design. Secondly, our policy makes individual banks choose to raise more capital. While it tightens the moral hazard constraint, the policy could raise the future value of investment and it shows the modi?fied policy is welfare dominant.

Title: Optimal Taxation with Risky Human Capital
Abstract: We study optimal tax policies in a life-cycle economy with risky human capital and permanent ability differences, where both ability and learning effort are private information of the agents. The optimal policies balance several goals: redistribution across agents, insurance against human capital shocks, incentives to accumulate human capital, and incentives to work. We show that, in the optimum, i) high-ability agents face risky consumption in order to elicit learning effort while low-ability agents are insured, ii) high-ability agents face a higher savings tax to discourage them from self-insuring, iii) under certain conditions, the inverse marginal labor income tax rate follows a random walk, and iv) the no distortion at the top result does not apply if discouraging labor supply increases incentives to invest in human capital. Quantitatively, we find large welfare gains for the U.S. from switching to an optimal tax system.

Title: Cultural Norms and Identity in Coordination Games
Abstract: We run experiments with a stag hunt and bargaining coordination game. Using a between-subjects design, we vary the identity of the opponent between someone of the same culture or a different culture. The idea is to see whether cultural norms or identity play a part in coordination decisions. We compare the responses of British and Asian students at the University of Exeter and show the cultural identity of the opponent by physical appearance. The players appear to use cultural stereotypes to predict behaviour, especially in the bargaining game which may require more strategic thought than the stag hunt game. In particular, the British act in way that indicates they believe the Asians will behave more cautiously than other British. According to our results, the stereotype of Asians being cautious is misleading.

Title: Dragon Slaying with Ambiguity: Theory and Experiments
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of ambiguity in the best shot and weakest link models of public good provision. The models are ?rst analysed theoretically. Then we conduct experiments to study how ambiguity affects behaviour in these games. We test whether subjects? perception of ambiguity differs between a local opponent and a foreign one. We fi?nd that an ambiguity safe strategy, is often chosen by subjects. This is compatible with the hypothesis that ambiguity aversion infl?uences behaviour in games. Subjects tend to choose contributions above (resp. below) the Nash equilibrium in the Best Shot (resp. Weakest Link) model.

Title: The Role of Heterogeneity in a Model of Strategic Experimentation
Abstract: In this paper, I examine the effect of introducing heterogeneity between players in a model of strategic experimentation. I consider a two-armed bandit problem in continuous time with one safe arm and a risky arm. There are two players and each has an access to such a bandit. A player using the safe arm experiences a safe flow payoff. The risky arm can either be good or bad. A bad risky arm is worse than the safe arm and the good risky arm is better than the safe arm. Players start with a common prior about the probability of the risky arm being good. At a time point, a player can choose only one of the arms. I show that if the degree of heterogeneity between the players is high enough, then there exists a unique Markov perfect equilibrium in simple cut-off strategies. The non-cooperative equilibrium in the heterogeneous model in terms of welfare, always gets a higher rank than any non-cooperative equilibrium of a homogeneous players model with same or more amount of experimentation in the benchmark.

Title: Marginal reforms to facilitate climate change mitigation: An assessment of costs and abilities to abate of different countries.
Abstract: Employing the by-production approach to modelling emission-generating technologies proposed in Murty, Russell, Levkoff [2012] and Murty [2015] and adapting the policy reform approach to taxation policy in public economics due to Feldstein [1975] and Guesnerie [1977], we propose a methodology to identify profit-increasing and emission non-increasing input and sequestration reforms and to compute marginal abatement costs (MACs) of countries. The proposed formulae are based purely on data that defines the current status-quo and gain significance when long-run abatement plans based on future projections of the economy are implemented in a piecemeal manner. We show that the so derived MAC of any country is the ratio of its reduction in profit (RIP) and its ability to abate (ATA) at the status-quo. The RIP and the ATA measure, respectively, the decrease in profit and the reduction in emission at the status-quo when the abatement strategy that results in the greatest proportional decrease in emission is adopted. While the RIP depends on factors such as the profitability of various inputs and the costs of sequestration at the status-quo, the ATA depends on factors such as the extents of usage of fossil-fuels and carbon sequestration efforts. The formulae derived are used to compute the RIP, ATA, and the MACs of a sample of 118 countries. A wide international variation is found in the estimates, indicating potentials for gains from international trading in emission given the current state of the world economy and its level of technological development. In particular, countries that have submitted the highest emission-reduction targets under the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) scheme to the UNFCCC are also among the countries with the highest MACs in our sample, while countries that have thus far shown caution in submitting their INDCs have low MACs. Carbon sequestration efforts such as afforestation contribute towards lowering MACs in countries that do undertake them.

Title: Trade, Law and Order, and Political Liberties: Theory and Application to English Medieval Boroughs
Abstract: We argue that trade opportunities, combined with the provision of law and order, may lead to local political liberties. In our model, a ruler chooses the size of an administration that (i) provides law and order for a merchant to use and (ii) collects taxes. Larger gains from trade increase the demand for law and order, which requires a larger administration. However, a larger administration is more difficult to monitor and allow local officials to expropriate merchants. When the resulting inefficiencies are significant, the ruler delegates control of the administration to the better-informed merchant, even though this makes tax evasion more tempting. We then analyze the emergence of local political liberties in post-Norman Conquest England (1066-1307) using data on taxation, commerce, and the behavior of local officials. This period marks the beginning of England's transition away from feudalism. We find that trade expansion coincides with widespread misbehavior by officials and, in line with the predictions of our model, an increasing willingness by the king to grant boroughs of high commercial value the right to elect local officials.

Title: Too Small To Protect? The Role of Firm Size in Trade Agreements
Abstract: This paper develops a new model of a trade agreement that puts at center stage the competing interests between firms within a sector. Larger firms favor trade liberalization whereas smaller firms favor protection. Lobbying by firms for or against the agreement is modelled as an all-pay auction, thus incorporating the feature that binding contracts over contributions for policies cannot be written. A new motive for trade agreement formation is uncovered in this framework whereby governments incentives to liberalize are driven by the lobbying process. If a proposed agreement is over non-tariff barriers then it always entails free trade. If a proposed agreement is over tariffs then it either entails free trade, which maximizes lobbying revenue, or the tariff revenue maximizing tariff. This outcome is supported by the surprising result that, off the equilibrium path, any tariff agreement that entails lobbying and positive tariffs yields lower expected revenue for the government than a free trade agreement involving no tariff revenue.

Title: Bankruptcy and Cross-Country Differences in Productivity
Abstract: Using a harmonized dataset constructed from national statistical agencies data for a sample of OECD countries, I document a systematic positive relationship between i) aggregate productivity, ii) the employment share by large firms and iii) the proportion of large firms in the economy. I propose that differences in bankruptcy procedures can explain this relationship. In a model of financial intermediation and informational frictions, I show that as bankruptcy procedures worsen  measured by the amount a lender can recover from bankrupt borrowers  lenders respond by shifting their portfolio of loans to smaller (less productive) enterprises. This finding is supported by empirical evidence: across countries, efficient bankruptcy procedures are associated with a higher proportion of new bank loans allocated to large firms. In the model, moving the level of recovery rate from the U.S. level to that of the lowest recovery rate country in the OECD sample reduces TFP by 30%.

Title: Religious fragmentation, social identity and rent-seeking: Evidence from an artefactual field experiment in India
Abstract: We examine the impact of religious identity and village-level religious fragmentation on rent seeking behavior. We report on a series of two-player Tullock contest experiments conducted on a sample of 516 Hindu and Muslim participants in rural West Bengal, India. Our treatments are the identity of the two players and the degree of religious fragmentation in the village where subjects reside. We find no statistically significant differences in rent seeking behavior across different villages. We also do not find any significant differences in behavior as a function of players' identities. This is in contrast to evidence from the same sample which recorded significant differences in cooperation levels in prisoners' dilemma and stag hunt games. We attribute this to the fact that social identity may have a more powerful effect on cooperation than on conflict.

Title: A Note on Simple Monetary Policy Rules with Labour Market and Financial Frictions
Abstract: We consider a New-Keynesian model with ?financial and labour market frictions where ?firms borrowing is limited by the enforcement constraint. The wage is set in a bargaining process where the fi?rm?s shareholder and worker share the production surplus. As debt service is considered to be a part of production costs, ?firms borrow to reduce the surplus which allows to lower the wage. We study the model?s response to ?nancial shock under two Taylor-type interest rate rules: ?first one responds to in?ation and borrowing, second - to in?ation and unemployment. We have found that the second rule delivers better policy in terms of the welfare measure. Additionally, we show that the feedback on unemployment in this rule depends on the extent of workers? bargaining power.

Title: Auctions with external incentives: Experimental
evidence
Abstract: We consider auctions where bidders have external incentives and focus on the case where their valuations in the auction are positively correlated with their productivity which matters in a second stage job market. We study how this affects bidding behavior and wages in the job market and proceed to test the models implication in an experiment where treatments differ according to which bids are disclosed. Our results broadly confirm the theoretical prediction that bidders tend to overbid, and their bidding behavior and wages are influenced by the disclosure rule. The data also suggests that the dispersion in worker wages is affected by the disclosure rule, suggesting the importance of reputational bidding.

Title: Modeling Emission-Generating Technologies: Reconciliation of Axiomatic and By-Production Approaches
Abstract: We study the link between the by-production approach of Murty, Russell, and Levkoff [2012 J. Environ. Econ.] (MRL) and the axiomatic approach of Murty [2015 Econ. Theory] to modelling emission-generating technologies. We show that the by-production technology of MRL, obtained as an intersection of two independent sub-technologies, satisfies all the Murty axioms. Conversely, a technology satisfying all these axioms decomposes into two independent subtechnologies having the MRL features. These two sub-technologies, reflect, respectively, the relations between goods in intended-output production designed by human engineers, on the one hand, and the emission-generating mechanism of nature governed by material-balance considerations, on the other. In either approach, the technology can be functionally represented by two radial distance functions with well-defined properties. These distance functions can also serve as measures of technological and environmental efficiency. We exploit the link between the by-production and axiomatic approaches to offer preliminary suggestions about suitable functional forms for the empirical estimation of the two distance functions.

Title: Measuring unilateral and multilateral gains from tackling current economic inefficiencies in CO2 reductions: Theory and evidence
Abstract: We develop a methodology for (a) constructing unilateral profit (producer surplus)- increasing and emission-decreasing policy reforms and (b) measuring marginal abatement cost (MAC), when countries operate inefficiently in meeting their self-imposed emission caps and when instantaneous radical jumps from their inefficient status-quos to their emission-constrained optima are infeasible due to existing institutional and political constraints. Data from 118 countries combined with the theoretical methodology developed reveals that (a) allocative inefficiencies are pervasive, (b) our proposed unilateral-efficiency increasing reform can result in more than 8% increase in global profit and 30% reduction in net global emission of CO2 - the biggest gainers being USA, China, Japan, Russia, India, and several countries from western European, and (c) MACs range from zero to 3,000 USD per ton of carbon (USDptc) in 94% of countries in our sample. MAC is more than (resp., less than) 1,000 USDptc in 80% of OECD (resp., 61% of non-OECD) countries. While MACs are zero for many countries in the former Soviet block, they are more than 2,000 USDptc for countries in western Europe. These differences in MACs imply considerable scope for multilateral efficiency improvements in meeting voluntary emission reduction targets through international emission trading and other international climate initiatives.

Title: Strategic Ambiguity and Decision-making: An Experimental Study
Abstract: We conducted a set of experiments to compare the effect of ambiguity in single person decisions and games. Our results suggest that ambiguity has a bigger impact in games than in ball and urn problems. We ?nd that ambiguity has the opposite effect in games of strategic substitutes and complements. This con?rms a theoretical prediction made by Eichberger and Kelsey (2002). The experiments also test whether subjects' ?perception of ambiguity differs when faced by a local opponent as opposed to a foreign one. Our results show that there is little evidence of more in?uence of ambiguity on behaviour when faced by foreign subjects.

Title: Optimal Fiscal Policy in a Model of Firm Entry and Financial Frictions
Abstract: This paper develops a general equilibrium model of firm entry and financial frictions. Movements in the volatility of firm-level shocks and aggregate productivity generate procyclical entry and a countercyclical firm default rate. We derive analytical results for optimal fiscal policy and show that the government faces two trade-offs. The first arises from a profit destruction and a consumer surplus effect when firm entry is endogenous. The second arises because financial frictions reduce firm entry and default is costly. We also study the optimal mix of taxes on labor-income and firm profits in a quantitative version of the model. We find that a countercyclical labor-income tax is always part of the optimal fiscal policy, whereas the cyclicality of the profit tax is sensitive to the source of aggregate fluctuations.

Title: Interest parity conditions during the classical gold standard (1880 -1914) - Evidence from the investment demand for bills of exchange in Europe 
Abstract: This paper examines several versions of the (covered and uncovered) interest parity condition that arguably held as regards the investment demand for bills of exchange during the classical gold standard (1880 - 1914). Contemporaneous guide books about the foreign exchanges report that close connections between the exchange and interest (or discount) rates arose mainly between London and the major financial centres on the European continent. As implied by the interest parity condition, and in particular when future exchange rate movements were covered via a suitable long-bill transaction, weekly data suggest indeed that between Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and London, the return from discounting bills of exchange in the local money market was roughly equivalent to the (exchange rate adjusted) return from investing in foreign bills.

Title: Does formative feedback help or hinder students? An empirical investigation
Abstract: The link between formative assessment and student performance is not entirely clear in the existing literature with some previous studies showing contradicting results. Although the debate is very old (since mid-1800s), previous research is almost exclusively based on elementary and secondary school students. This paper attempts to add to the existing literature by focusing on data from a large scale experiment (a class of 578 UK first year undergraduate students enrolled on Introduction to Statistics) to determine whether online, formative (non-compulsory) homework helps or hinders students. The results suggest that completing formative assessment tasks contributes to higher grades but only for good students. The result is robust to a variety of specifications and after controlling for a large number of student characteristics (including nationality, gender, ethnicity, whether a student has completed a Maths or Economics A-Level in Secondary School, amongst others) and the level of student ability/effort. This study shows, therefore, that formative homework might contribute to amplifying inequalities amongst students and that other strategies are needed to close the gap between the top and bottom performing students.

Title: Endogenous Sanctioning Institutions and Migration Patterns: Experimental Evidence
Abstract: We experimentally analyze the effect of the endogenous choice of sanctioning institutions on cooperation and migration patterns across societies. In our experiment, subjects are allocated to one of two groups, are endowed with group-specific preferences, and play a public goods game for 30 periods. Each period, subjects can move between groups and, at fixed intervals, can vote on whether to implement formal (centralized) sanctioning institutions in their group. We compare this environment to one in which only one group is exogenously endowed with sanctioning institutions. We find that subjects' ability to vote on institutions leads to (i) a more efficient partition of subjects between groups, (ii) a lower migration rate, (iii) an increase in overall payoffs, and (iv) a decrease in both inter- and intra-groups (payoff) inequality. Over time, subjects tend to vote for sanctioning institutions and contribute to the public good.

Title: The Role of Heterogeneity in a model of Strategic Experimentation
Abstract: In this paper, I examine a situation where economic agents facing a trade-off between exploring a new option and exploiting their existing knowledge about a safe option, are heterogeneous with respect to their innate abilities in exploring the new option. I consider a two-armed bandit framework in continuous time with one safe arm and one risky arm. There are two players and each has access to an identical safe arm and a risky arm. A player using the safe arm experiences a safe flow payoff whereas the payoff from a bad risky arm is worse than the safe arm and that of the good risky arm is better than the safe arm. Players start with a common prior about the probability of the risky arm being good. I show that if the degree of heterogeneity between the players is high enough, then there exists a Markov perfect equilibrium in simple cutoff strategies. For any degree of heterogeneity, there always exist equilibria where at least one player uses a non-cutoff strategy. When the equilibrium in cutoff strategies exists, it strictly dominates any other equilibria. When there does not exist any equilibrium in cutoff strategies, for some range of heterogeneity we can identify the welfare maximising equilibrium. For very low range of heterogeneity, the ranking among the equilibria is ambiguous.

Title: Preordered Service in Contract Enforcement
Abstract: We propose a procedural rule that we refer to as preordered service to replace sequential service of civil cases for breach of contract. The judiciary preannounces a list that ranks all entities that may enter contracts by some uniquely identifying information, such as taxpayer numbers. Courts use this list to enforce the contracts of the highest ranked entities that file a contract case. In theory, unlike sequential service, preordered service ensures efficiency in a population of investment games. Results from a laboratory experiment suggest that it may substantially reduce the caseload at courts and mitigate payoff inequality.

Title: Ambiguity and the Centipede Game: Strategic Uncertainty in Multi-Stage Games
Abstract: We propose a solution concept for a class of extensive form games with ambiguity. Speci?cally we consider multi-stage games. Players have CEU preferences. The associated ambiguous beliefs are revised by Generalized Bayesian Updating. We assume individuals take account of possible changes in their preferences by using consistent planning. We show that if there is ambiguity in the centipede game it is possible to sustain ?cooperation? for many periods as part of a consistent-planning equilibrium under ambiguity. In a non-cooperative bargaining game we show that ambiguity may be a cause of delay in bargaining.

Title: Is Lecture Capture benefiting (all) HE students? An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: The arguments for and against lecture capture have been going for some time and the debate is far from being settled definitely either way. Most of the existing research about the impact of lecture capture on student attainment seems to show negligible or little effects while examples of a negative relationship between lecture capture and learning outcomes abound. The main purpose of this study is to add to the existing literature by conducting a large scale investigation (involving more than 2400 students in 26 modules offered by the economics department of a major British university) on whether lecture capture improves student performance. A secondary objective is to determine whether some groups of students use lecture capture more than others and whether lecture capture can lead to differing benefits for students in different types of subjects. The data shows, in line with previous studies, that certain groups of students use lecture recordings significantly more than their peers (e.g. female students, international students, students from a low socio-economic background and ethnic minorities). Other results were unexpected. Notably, disabled students (including the sub-group of dyslexic students) and mature students were found not to not use lecture recordings more than others.  Also, students taking quantitative modules and students doing economics majors were found to use lecture recordings significantly less. The regression analysis showed that lecture recordings yielded (at most) a small positive effect on student performance.

Title: Conditional generosity and uncertain income: Evidence from five experiments
Abstract: We study how other-regarding behavior extends to environments with income uncertainty and conditional commitments. Should fundraisers ask a banker to donate if he earns a bonus or wait and ask after the bonus is known? Standard EU theory predicts these are equivalent; loss-aversion and signaling models predict a larger commitment before the bonus is known; theories of affect predict the reverse. In five experiments incorporating lab and field elements (N=1363), we solicited charitable donations from lottery winnings worth between $10 and $30, varying the conditionality of donations between participants. While the results suggest some heterogeneity across experimental contexts and demographic groups, in each experiment conditional donations (if you win) were higher than ex-post donations. Pooling across experiments, this is strongly statistically significant; we find a 23% greater likelihood of donating and a 25% larger average donation commitment in the Before treatment. Our findings add to our understanding of pro-social behavior and have implications for charitable fundraising, for effective altruism giving pledges, and for experimental methodology.

Title: Propagation of Commodity Market Shocks
Abstract: We address the transmission of commodity price shocks and assess how source-specific shocks spillover to other exporting countries.Applying a multi-country panel VAR, we show that a model that allows for cross-country interdependencies is an appropriate specification of commodity markets. Source-specific shocks therefore have both direct and spillover effects and the results indicate that these spillover effects are both statistically and economically significant. Accounting for these spillover effects has important implications for understanding commodity price dynamics and the management of price shocks in both exporting and importing countries.

Title: The Macroeconomic Implications of Firm Selection
Abstract: This paper studies the macroeconomic implications of firm selection in a model with monopolistic competition and translog preferences. Firm selection magnifies the impact of aggregate technology shocks. Magnication is limited by diminishing returns to new varieties and misallocation. We provide analytical results linking selection, diminishing returns, and misallocation with measured total factor productivity (TFP) and the distribution of firm-level productivity. A calibrated version of our model suggests the contribution of firm selection to variations in TFP is over 20 percent.

Title: Tort Liability and Unawareness
Abstract: Unawareness is a form of bounded rationality where a person fails to conceive all feasible acts or consequences or to perceive as feasible all conceivable act-consequence links. We study the implications of unawareness for tort law, where relevant examples include the discovery of a new product or technology (new act), of a new disease or injury (new consequence), or that a product can cause an injury (new link). We argue that negligence has an important advantage over strict liability in a world with unawarenessnegligence, through the stipulation of due care standards, spreads awareness about the updated probability of harm.

Title: Office-Holding Premia and Representative Democracy
Abstract: I consider a policy issue stylized as redistribution in a representative democracy in which holding o ce o ers an income premium. Predominance of high earners in the legislature likely implies that not a single lawmaker shares the policy preferences of lower- income citizens, because it arises in only two ways. First, chance favors high-income candidates while in the majority of districts, the strict majority of political candidates are lower-income citizens, which seems counterfactual. Second, high o ce-holding premia induce legislators from all backgrounds to oppose redistribution once in o ce. Either legislators are recruited from an elite, or some forget where they came from.

Title: A Test of Dynamic Consistency and Consequentialism in the Presence of Ambiguity
Abstract: We test dynamic consistency and consequentialism, two key principles of dynamic decision making under ambiguity and relate violations of these principles to subjects ambiguity at- titudes. In our experiment, subjects received a signal which made it attractive for ambiguity averse subjects to deviate from their ex- ante contingent plan and violate dynamic consistency. We found that ambiguity averse subjects were indeed more likely to violate dynamic consistency than ambiguity neutral subjects, but not consequentialism.

Title: Response surface regressions for critical value bounds and approximate p-values in equilibrium correction models
Abstract: Single-equation conditional equilibrium correction models can be used to test for the existence of a level relationship among the variables of interest. The distributions of the respective test statistics are nonstandard under the null hypothesis of no such relationship and critical values need to be obtained with stochastic simulations. We compute more than 95 billion F -statistics and 57 billion t-statistics for a large number of specifications of the Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001, Journal of Applied Econometrics 16: 289326) bounds test. Our large-scale simulations enable us to draw smooth density functions and to estimate response surface models that improve upon and substantially extend the set of available critical values for the bounds test. Besides covering the full range of possible sample sizes and lag orders, our approach notably allows for any number of variables in the long-run level relationship by exploiting the diminishing effect on the distributions of adding another variable to the model. The computation of approximate p-values enables a fine-grained statistical inference and allows us to quantify the finite-sample distortions from using asymptotic critical values. We find that the bounds test can be easily oversized by more than 5 percentage points in small samples.

Title: The Impact of Weather on Commodity Prices: A Warning for the Future
Abstract: Drawing on the most recent advances of the panel VAR literature, we investigate the impact of weather on commodity prices. We first test our model against alternative models. Then, we use it to simulate scenarios to study the impact of weather on commodity price transmission. We propose a framework that can be generalized to assess the impact of weather on a variety of commodity markets. The results show that (i) while shocks to temperatures affect commodity prices, precipitations are less relevant; (ii) an increase in temperatures is likely to increase prices; (iii) the impact on prices is not only direct but it spills over to other exporting countries; (iv) simulating a scenario compatible with global warming we find that it is likely to lead to a substantial increase in commodity prices and spillover effects; (v) these effects are amplified if we account for a contemporaneous shock to the economy. We discuss implications for the future, which can be useful for policy implementation.

Title: Who Marries Whom? The Role of Identity, Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills in Marriage
Abstract: I estimate a structural model of marriage sorting on a representative sample of British individuals. The paper first investigates the importance of numerical skills in the selection of the partner and the role of identity for marriage matching on a British sample. The findings show that identity is among the most important attributes, together with education and physical characteristics, in marriage sorting. Cognitive skills are both direct and indirect determinants of marriage matching. Personality traits are also relevant in the choice of the partner: conscientiousness and openness to experience play, in addition to risk propensity, a direct and an indirect role, while agreeableness, extraversion and neuroticism matter only indirectly. Interesting findings, robust to both alternative specifications and a sensitivity analysis, and heterogeneous preferences between males and females emerge from the analysis.

Title: Weather, Prices and Spillovers
Abstract: Changes in weather patterns associated with climate change can be an important determinant of commodity price volatility. In this paper, we provide new insights into this issue from two perspectives. First, by using detailed country-level precipitation data for a specific commodity (bananas), and employing a panel VAR model, we show that untypical rainfall patterns are an important influence on export prices and that the impact on export prices varies across exporters given the largely uncorrelated experience of anomalous levels of precipitation. Second, we show that source-specific rainfall patterns generate spillovers across competing exporters and these spillover effects can dominate the own-country precipitation anomaly effect. Accounting for these spillover effects is important for several reasons: (i) the aggregate impact of weather fluctuations on importers depends on the magnitude of these effects which we show to be quantitatively strong; (ii) for some exporters, the spillover effect on export prices can be a more important source of price volatility than their own experience of untypical weather; (iii) given the frequency of precipitation anomalies across all export countries, untypical variations in weather is an important source of commodity price volatility for all exporters and importers. In sum, the impact of climate-related weather events on prices is more nuanced than recent research has suggested.

Title: Increasing Employment Through the Partial Release of Information
Abstract: We investigate whether an agency can increase employment by strategically coarsening information about workers' skills and abilities to employers. Theoretically, we find that such an increase is possible and a range of employment levels can be supported in equilibrium. We test this possibility using laboratory experiments under three conditions: full information, coarse and verifiable information, and coarse but not verifiable information. We find that, compared with full information, both treatments with coarse information increase employment at the expense of the employers' profits but not the highest theoretically achievable levels. We also find verifiability affects several aspects of behavior.

Title: Incentives and Performance of Agents in a Microfinance Bank
Abstract: An important aspect of providing credit to the poor is the mechanism adopted by the credit institutions to do so. Most microfinance banks use field agents to acquire new borrowers, manage the account and collect repayments. How does the supply of credit change with a change in incentives provided to such field agents? Mann Deshi Bank, a microfinance bank in India, changed its remuneration scheme from a pure commission based to a mixed scheme with a combination of a base salary and other incentives. This paper examines the effect it had on the effort and the performance of the agents by using a rich panel data on the banks joint liability lending product. The results show that the change in the contract form with a large flat wage and reduced incentives improved performance of the agents in terms of the quantity (increase in the number of borrowers acquired) and quality (the borrowers acquired had fewer delays in repayments). We find evidence of mixed contract agents exerting significantly more effort than the pure commission agents to ascertain borrower quality.

Title: Altering Wait Time Information to Reduce A&E Overcrowding
Abstract: A&E overcrowding is an important problem since many are not seen in a sufficiently quick time. There is evidence that the situation can be improved without adding additional resources by diverting would-be A&E patients to alternative centres of urgent care, for example, Minor Injury Units (MIUs). The aim of this paper is to investigate how access to information on waiting times may influence decision making. We collect laboratory data where subjects are offered a choice between receiving treatment at A&E and MIU. The subjects face a random delay at the A&E but a known wait at the MIU. We manipulate the information that the subjects receive from the probabilities (risk) of the different waiting times at the A&E from known probabilities to merely a vague indication of the waiting time (ambiguity). We find that subjects demonstrate a strong preference for the A&E. Subjects display risk neutrality for the A&E waiting time but are ambiguity averse when waiting times are relatively short and ambiguity-seeking when waiting times are relatively long. This indicates that perhaps partial revelation of waiting times may be optimal. Our research will inform stakeholder decision-making at the operational level (such as individual UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts) about strategy regarding the release of timing information.
